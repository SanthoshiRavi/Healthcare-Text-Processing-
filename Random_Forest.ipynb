            "Article ID: 38762728, Title: Drug release profile of a novel exenatide long-term drug delivery system (OKV-119) administered to cats., Abstract: Beneficial weight-loss properties of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) in obese people, with corresponding improvements in cardiometabolic risk factors, are well established. OKV-119 is an investigational drug delivery system that is being developed for the long-term delivery of the GLP-1RA exenatide to feline patients. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the drug release characteristics of subcutaneous OKV-119 implants configured to release exenatide for 84 days. Following a 7-day acclimation period, five purpose-bred cats were implanted with OKV-119 protypes and observed for a 112-day study period. Food intake, weekly plasma exenatide concentrations and body weight were measured. Exenatide plasma concentrations were detected at the first measured timepoint (Day 7) and maintained above baseline for over 84 Days. Over the first 28 days, reduced caloric intake and a reduction in body weight were observed in four of five cats. In these cats, a body weight reduction of at least 5% was maintained throughout the 112-day study period. This study demonstrates that a single OKV-119 implant can deliver the GLP-1RA exenatide for a months long duration. Results suggest that exposure to exenatide plasma concentrations ranging from 1.5 ng/ml to 4 ng/ml are sufficient for inducing weight loss in cats.\n",

            "Article ID: 38762596, Title: PPA1 promotes adipogenesis by regulating the stability of C/EBPs., Abstract: Adipogenesis significantly contributes to healthy adipose tissue expansion in obesity. Increasing adipocyte number or function to alleviate adipose tissue overload could serve as a therapeutic strategy for both lipodystrophy and obesity-related metabolic syndrome. Inorganic pyrophosphatase (PPA1) is an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of pyrophosphate (PPi) and is involved in many biochemical reactions, but its function in adipose tissue has not been studied previously. In this study, we demonstrated that adipose-specific PPA1 knockout (PPA1<sup>AKO</sup>) mice showed lipodystrophy and spontaneously developed hepatic steatosis and severe insulin resistance under normal chow diet feeding. PPA1 deficiency suppressed the differentiation of primary adipocyte precursors and 3T3-L1 cells. Notably, PPA1 overexpression can restore inhibited adipogenesis in preadipocytes isolated from db/db mice and type 2 diabetes patients. Mechanistic studies have revealed that PPA1 acts as a positive regulator of early adipocyte differentiation by promoting CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein&#x3b2; and &#x3b4; (C/EBP&#x3b2; and &#x3b4;) protein stability. Moreover, the function of PPA1 in adipogenesis is independent of its PPi catalytic activity. Collectively, our in vivo and in vitro findings demonstrated that PPA1 is a novel critical upstream regulator of adipogenesis, controlling adipose tissue development and whole-body metabolic homeostasis.\n",

            "Article ID: 38762574, Title: Network-targeted transcranial direct current stimulation of the hypothalamus appetite-control network: a feasibility study., Abstract: The hypothalamus is the key regulator for energy homeostasis and is functionally connected to striatal and cortical regions vital for the inhibitory control of appetite. Hence, the ability to non-invasively modulate the hypothalamus network could open new ways for the treatment of metabolic diseases. Here, we tested a novel method for network-targeted transcranial direct current stimulation (net-tDCS) to influence the excitability of brain regions involved in the control of appetite. Based on the resting-state functional connectivity map of the hypothalamus, a 12-channel net-tDCS protocol was generated (Neuroelectrics Starstim system), which included anodal, cathodal and sham stimulation. Ten participants with overweight or obesity were enrolled in a sham-controlled, crossover study. During stimulation or sham control, participants completed a stop-signal task to measure inhibitory control. Overall, stimulation was well tolerated. Anodal net-tDCS resulted in faster stop signal reaction time (SSRT) compared to sham (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.039) and cathodal net-tDCS (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.042). Baseline functional connectivity of the target network correlated with SSRT after anodal compared to sham stimulation (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.016). These preliminary data indicate that modulating hypothalamus functional network connectivity via net-tDCS may result in improved inhibitory control. Further studies need to evaluate the effects on eating behavior and metabolism.\n",

The aim of this study was estimating risk ratio of mortality in the off-pump coronary bypass compared with the on-pump using a causal model known as collaborative targeted maximum likelihood estimation (C-TMLE). The data of the Tehran Heart Cohort study from 2007 to 2020 was used. A collaborative targeted maximum likelihood estimation and targeted maximum likelihood estimation, and propensity score (PS) adjustment methods were used to estimate causal risk ratio adjusting for the minimum sufficient set of confounders, and the results were compared. Among 24,883 participants (73.6% male), 5566 patients died during an average of 8.2&#xa0;years of follow-up. The risk ratio estimates (95% confidence intervals) by unadjusted log-binomial regression model, PS adjustment, TMLE, and C-TMLE methods were 0.86 (0.78-0.95), 0.88 (0.80-0.97), 0.88 (0.80-0.97), and 0.87(0.85-0.89), respectively. This study provides evidence for a protective effect of off-pump surgery on mortality risk for up to 8 years in diabetic and non-diabetic patients.\n",

            "Article ID: 38762560, Title: Oral administration of coenzyme Q10 ameliorates memory impairment induced by nicotine-ethanol abstinence through restoration of biochemical changes in male rat hippocampal tissues., Abstract: Substance abuse among adolescents has become a growing issue throughout the world. The significance of research on this life period is based on the occurrence of neurobiological changes in adolescent brain which makes the individual more susceptible for risk-taking and impulsive behaviors. Alcohol and nicotine are among the most available drugs of abuse in adolescents. Prolonged consumption of nicotine and alcohol leads to drug dependence and withdrawal which induce various dysfunctions such as memory loss. Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ<sub>10)</sub> is known to improve learning and memory deficits induced by various pathological conditions such as Diabetes mellitus and Alzheimer's disease. In the present study we investigated whether CoQ<sub>10</sub> treatment ameliorates memory loss following a nicotine-ethanol abstinence. Morris water maze and novel object recognition tests were done in male Wistar rats undergone nicotine-ethanol abstinence and the effect of CoQ10 was assessed on at behavioral and biochemical levels. Results indicated that nicotine-ethanol abstinence induces memory dysfunction which is associated with increased oxidative and inflammatory response, reduced cholinergic and neurotrophic function plus elevated Amyloid-B levels in hippocampi. CoQ<sub>10</sub> treatment prevented memory deficits and biochemical alterations. Interestingly, this ameliorative effect of CoQ<sub>10</sub> was found to be dose-dependent in most experiments and almost equipotential to that of bupropion and naloxone co-administration. CoQ<sub>10</sub> treatment could effectively improve memory defects induced by nicotine-ethanol consumption through attenuation of oxidative damage, inflammation, amyloid-B level and enhancement of cholinergic and neurotrophic drive. Further studies are required to assess the unknown side effects and high dose tolerability of the drug in human subjects.\n",

            "Article ID: 38762479, Title: Tlr9 deficiency in B cells leads to obesity by promoting inflammation and gut dysbiosis., Abstract: Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) recognizes bacterial, viral and self DNA and play an important role in immunity and inflammation. However, the role of TLR9 in obesity is less well-studied. Here, we generate B-cell-specific Tlr9-deficient (Tlr9<sup>fl/fl</sup>/Cd19Cre<sup>+/-</sup>, KO) B6 mice and model obesity using a high-fat diet. Compared with control mice, B-cell-specific-Tlr9-deficient mice exhibited increased fat tissue inflammation, weight gain, and impaired glucose and insulin tolerance. Furthermore, the frequencies of IL-10-producing-B cells and marginal zone B cells were reduced, and those of follicular and germinal center B cells were increased. This was associated with increased frequencies of IFN&#x3b3;-producing-T cells and increased follicular helper cells. In addition, gut microbiota from the KO mice induced a pro-inflammatory state leading to immunological and metabolic dysregulation when transferred to germ-free mice. Using 16&#x2009;S rRNA gene sequencing, we identify altered gut microbial communities including reduced Lachnospiraceae, which may play a role in altered metabolism in KO mice. We identify an important network involving Tlr9, Irf4 and Il-10 interconnecting metabolic homeostasis, with the function of B and T cells, and gut microbiota in obesity.\n",

Leveraging artificial intelligence, particularly eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), we devise robust risk assessment models for T2D. Drawing upon comprehensive genetic and medical imaging datasets from 68,911 individuals in the Taiwan Biobank, our models integrate Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS), Multi-image Risk Scores (MRS), and demographic variables, such as age, sex, and T2D family history. Here, we show that our model achieves an Area Under the Receiver Operating Curve (AUC) of 0.94, effectively identifying high-risk T2D subgroups. A streamlined model featuring eight key variables also maintains a high AUC of 0.939. This high accuracy for T2D risk assessment promises to catalyze early detection and preventive strategies. Moreover, we introduce an accessible online risk assessment tool for T2D, facilitating broader applicability and dissemination of our findings.\n",

            "Article ID: 38762331, Title: Gastric conduit reconstruction after esophagectomy., Abstract: A high risk of complications still accompanies gastric conduit reconstruction after esophagectomy. In this narrative review, we summarize the technological progress and the problems of gastric conduit reconstruction after esophagectomy. Several types of gastric conduits exist, including the whole stomach and the narrow gastric tube. The clinical outcomes are similar between the two types of conduits. Sufficient blood supply to the conduit is mandatory for a successful esophageal reconstruction. Recently, due to the availability of equipment and its convenience, indocyanine green angiography has been rapidly spreading. When the blood perfusion of the planning anastomotic site is insufficient, several techniques, such as the Kocher maneuver, pedunculated gastric tube with duodenal transection, and additional microvascular anastomosis, exist to decrease the risk of anastomotic failure. There are two different anastomotic sites, cervical and thoracic, and mainly two reconstructive routes, retrosternal and posterior mediastinal routes. Meta-analyses showed no significant difference in outcomes between the anastomotic sites as well as the reconstructive routes. Anastomotic techniques include hand-sewn, circular, and linear stapling. Anastomoses using linear stapling is advantageous in decreasing anastomosis-related complications. Arteriosclerosis and poorly controlled diabetes are the risk factors for anastomotic leakage, while a narrow upper mediastinal space and a damaged stomach predict leakage. Although standardization among the institutional team members is essential to decrease anastomotic complications, surgeons should learn several technical options for predictable or unpredictable intraoperative situations.\n",

            "Article ID: 38762243, Title: Tear biomarkers., Abstract: An extensive exploration of lacrimal fluid molecular biomarkers in understanding and diagnosing a spectrum of ocular and systemic diseases is presented. The chapter provides an overview of lacrimal fluid composition, elucidating the roles of proteins, lipids, metabolites, and nucleic acids within the tear film. Pooled versus single-tear analysis is discussed to underline the benefits and challenges associated with both approaches, offering insights into optimal strategies for tear sample analysis. Subsequently, an in-depth analysis of tear collection methods is presented, with a focus on Schirmer's test strips and microcapillary tubes methods. Alternative tear collection techniques are also explored, shedding light on their applicability and advantages. Variability factors, including age, sex, and diurnal fluctuations, are examined in the context of their impact on tear biomarker analysis. The main body of the chapter is dedicated to discussing specific biomarkers associated with ocular discomfort and a wide array of ocular diseases. From dry eye disease and thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy to keratoconus, age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, and glaucoma, the intricate relationship between molecular biomarkers and these conditions is thoroughly dissected. Expanding beyond ocular pathologies, the chapter explores the applicability of tear biomarkers in diagnosing systemic diseases such as multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and cancer. This broader perspective underscores the potential of lacrimal fluid analysis in offering non-invasive diagnostic tools for conditions with far-reaching implications.\n",

In the context of chronic liver disease, liver macrophage activation and response to hepatocellular damage is dependent on profound metabolic changes. Here, we sought to identify the role of an important metabolic regulator, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), specifically within myeloid cells during the progression of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and whether treatment with metformin, a first line therapy for diabetes and activator of AMPK could stem disease progression. Male and female Prkaa1<sup>fl/fl</sup>/Prkaa2<sup>fl/fl</sup> (Flox) control and Flox-LysM-Cre<sup>+</sup> (MacKO) mice were fed a low-fat control or a choline-deficient, amino acid defined 45% Kcal high fat diet (CDAHFD) for 8 weeks, where metformin was introduced in the drinking water (50 or 250 mg/kg/day) for the last 4 weeks. Hepatic steatosis and fibrosis were dramatically increased in response to CDAHFD-feeding compared to low-fat control. While myeloid AMPK signaling had no effect on markers of hepatic steatosis or circulating markers, fibrosis as measured by total liver collagen was significantly elevated in livers from MacKO mice, independent of sex. Although treatment with 50 mg/kg/day metformin had no effect on any parameter, intervention with 250 mg/kg/day metformin completely ameliorated hepatic steatosis and fibrosis in both male and female mice. While the protective effect of metformin was associated with lower final body weight, decrease expression of lipogenic and Col1a1 transcripts, it was independent of myeloid AMPK signaling. These results suggest that endogenous AMPK signaling in myeloid cells, both liver-resident and infiltrating, acts to restrict fibrogenesis during CDAHFD-induced NASH progression but is not the mechanism by which metformin improves markers of NASH.\n",

With multiple pleotropic actions beyond their insulinotropic and weight loss ones, including anti-inflammatory and anti-insulin-resistant effects selectively mediated by their receptors present within numerous organs, this drug class offers potential efficacy for an increasing number of systemic and neurological disorders whose current treatment is inadequate. Among these are a host of neurodegenerative disorders that are prevalent in the elderly, such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease, which have bucked previous therapeutic approaches. An increasing preclinical, clinical, and epidemiological literature suggests that select incretin mimetics may provide an effective treatment strategy, but 'which ones' for 'which disorders' and 'when' remain key open questions.\n",

Recent studies have demonstrated the association between histone lactylation, a unique form of post-translational modification, and pathogenesis of CMDs, apparently through epigenetic mechanisms. Lactylation has been indicated to regulate key aspects of metabolism, inflammation, and cardiovascular function in the realm of CMDs in a cellular and tissue-specific manner. A better understanding of the molecular, cellular and physiological domains of lactylation in the etiology of CMDs is expected to offer new insights into etiopathogenesis, hazardous factor control and therapeutic development for these challenging ailments.\n",

            "Article ID: 38762036, Title: SIRT-Associated Attenuation of Cellular Senescence in Vascular Wall., Abstract: This review focuses on the vital function that SIRT1 and other sirtuins play in promoting cellular senescence in vascular smooth muscle cells, which is a key element in the pathogenesis of vascular aging and associated cardiovascular diseases. Vascular aging is a gradual process caused by the accumulation of senescent cells, which results in increased vascular remodeling, stiffness, and diminished angiogenic ability. Such physiological alterations are characterized by a complex interplay of environmental and genetic variables, including oxidative stress and telomere attrition, which affect gene expression patterns and trigger cell growth arrest. SIRT1 has been highlighted for its potential to reduce cellular senescence through modulation of multiple signaling cascades, particularly the endothelial nitric oxide (eNOS)/NO signaling pathway. It also modulates cell cycle through p53 inactivation and suppresses NF-&#x3ba;B mediated expression of adhesive molecules at the vascular level. The study also examines the therapeutic potential of sirtuin modulation in vascular health, identifying SIRT1 and its sirtuin counterparts as potential targets for reducing vascular aging. This study sheds light on the molecular basis of vascular aging and the beneficial effects of sirtuins, paving the way for the development of tailored therapies aimed at enhancing vascular health and prolonging life.\n",

            "Article ID: 38762033, Title: Visualizing the active site oxyanion loop transition upon ensitrelvir binding and transient dimerization of SARS-CoV-2 main protease., Abstract: N-terminal autoprocessing from its polyprotein precursor enables creating the mature-like stable dimer interface of SARS-CoV-2 main protease (MPro), concomitant with the active site oxyanion loop equilibrium transitioning to the active conformation (E*) and onset of catalytic activity. Through mutagenesis of critical interface residues and evaluating noncovalent inhibitor (ensitrelvir, ESV) facilitated dimerization through its weak binding to MPro, we demonstrate that residues extending from Ser1 through Glu14 are critical for dimerization. Combined mutations G11A, E290A and R298A (MPro<sup>TM</sup>) restrict dimerization even upon binding of ESV to monomeric MPro<sup>TM</sup> with an inhibitor dissociation constant of 7.4 &#xb1; 1.6 &#xb5;M. Contrasting the covalent inhibitor NMV or GC373 binding to monomeric MPro, ESV binding enabled capturing the transition of the oxyanion loop conformations in the absence of a reactive warhead and independent of dimerization. Characterization of complexes by room-temperature X-ray crystallography reveals ESV bound to the E* state of monomeric MPro as well as an intermediate approaching the inactive state (E). It appears that the E* to E equilibrium shift occurs initially from G138-F140 residues, leading to the unwinding of the loop and formation of the 3<sub>10</sub>-helix. Finally, we describe a transient dimer structure of the MPro precursor held together through interactions of residues A5-G11 with distinct states of the active sites, E and E*, likely representing an intermediate in the autoprocessing pathway.\n",

The aim of this study was to determine concentrations of ghrelin, PYY, and GLP-1 in older adults exhibiting an anorexia of ageing phenotype. Thirteen older adults with healthy appetite (OA-HA; 8f, 75&#xb1;7 years, 26.0&#xb1;3.2 kg&#xb7;m<sup>-2</sup>), fifteen older adults with low appetite (OA-LA; 10f, 72&#xb1;7 years, 23.6&#xb1;3.1 kg&#xb7;m<sup>-2</sup>), and twelve young adults (YA; 6f, 22&#xb1;2 years, 24.4&#xb1;2.0 kg&#xb7;m<sup>-2</sup>) completed the study. Healthy appetite and low appetite were determined based on BMI, habitual energy intake, self-reported appetite, and laboratory-assessed ad libitum lunch intake. Participants provided a fasted measure of subjective appetite and blood sample (0 minutes) before consuming a standardised breakfast (450 kcal). Appetite was measured and blood samples were drawn throughout a 240-minute rest period. At 240 minutes, an ad libitum lunch meal was consumed. Relative intake at lunch (expressed as percentage of estimated total energy requirement) was lower for OA-LA (19.8&#xb1;7.7%) than YA (41.5&#xb1;9.2%, p&lt;0.001) and OA-HA (37.3&#xb1;10.0%, p&lt;0.001). Ghrelin suppression was greater for OA-LA (net AUC, -78719&#xb1;74788 pg&#xb7;mL<sup>-1</sup>&#xb7;240min<sup>-1</sup>) than both YA (-23899&#xb1;27733 pg&#xb7;mL<sup>-1</sup>&#xb7;240min<sup>-1</sup>, p=0.016) and OA-HA (-21144&#xb1;31161 pg&#xb7;mL<sup>-1</sup>&#xb7;240min<sup>-1</sup>, p=0.009). There were trends for higher GLP-1 concentrations in OA-LA compared with YA at 90 minutes (8.85&#xb1;10.4 pM vs. 1.88&#xb1;4.63 pM, p=0.073) and 180 minutes (5.00&#xb1;4.71 pM vs. 1.07&#xb1;2.83 pM, p=0.065). There was a trend for a greater PYY response for OA-LA compared with OA-HA (net AUC p=0.062). \"Anorexigenic response score\" - a composite score of gut hormone responses to feeding - showed greater anorexigenic response in OA-LA, compared with YA and OA-HA. No differences were seen in subjective appetite. These observations suggest augmented anorexigenic responses of gut hormones to feeding may be causal mechanisms of anorexia of ageing.\n",

Recent studies have highlighted the potential negative impact of maternal diabetes on embryonic neurodevelopment, suggesting that intrauterine hyperglycemia could pose an additional risk to early brain development and contribute to the development of ASD. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the current research on the relationship between various forms of maternal diabetes, such as type 1 diabetes mellitus, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and gestational diabetes mellitus, and the likelihood of ASD in offspring. The study elucidates the potential mechanisms through which maternal hyperglycemia affects fetal development, involving metabolic hormones, immune dysregulation, heightened oxidative stress, and epigenetic alterations. The findings of this review offer valuable insights for potential preventive measures and evidence-based interventions targeting ASD.\n",

            "Article ID: 38761896, Title: SIRT1/AMPK-mediated pathway: Ferulic acid from sugar beet pulp mitigating obesity-induced diabetes-linked complications and improving metabolic health., Abstract: Obesity-induced type 2 diabetes (T2D) increases the risk of metabolic syndrome due to the high calorie intake. The role of sugar beet pulp (SBP) in T2D and the mechanism of its action remain unclear, though it is abundant in phenolics and has antioxidant activity. In this study, we isolated and purified ferulic acid from SBP, referred to as SBP-E, and studied the underlying molecular mechanisms in the regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism developing high glucose/high fat diet-induced diabetic models in vitro and in vivo. SBP-E showed no cytotoxicity and reduced the oxidative stress by increasing glutathione (GSH) in human liver (HepG2) and rat skeletal muscle (L6) cells. It also decreased body weight gain, food intake, fasting blood glucose levels (FBGL), glucose intolerance, hepatic steatosis, and lipid accumulation. Additionally, SBP-E decreased the oxidative stress and improved the antioxidant enzyme levels in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced T2D mice. Further, SBP-E reduced plasma and liver advanced glycation end products (AGEs), malondialdehyde (MDA), and pro-inflammatory cytokines, and increased anti-inflammatory cytokines in HFD-fed mice. Importantly, SBP-E significantly elevated AMPK, glucose transporter, SIRT1 activity, and Nrf2 expression and decreased ACC expression and SREBP1 levels in diabetic models. Collectively, our study results suggest that SBP-E treatment can improve obesity-induced T2D by regulating glucose and lipid metabolism via SIRT1/AMPK signalling and the AMPK/SREBP1/ACC1 pathway.\n",

            "Article ID: 38761874, Title: Chromatic visual evoked potentials: a review of physiology, methods and clinical applications., Abstract: Objective assessment of the visual system can be performed electrophysiologically using the visual evoked potential (VEP). In many clinical circumstances, this is performed using high contrast achromatic patterns or diffuse flash stimuli. These methods are clinically valuable but they may only assess a subset of possible physiological circuitries within the visual system, particularly those involved in achromatic (luminance) processing. The use of chromatic VEPs (cVEPs) in addition to standard VEPs can inform us of the function or dysfunction of chromatic pathways. The chromatic VEP has been well studied in human health and disease. Yet, to date our knowledge of their underlying mechanisms and applications remains limited. This likely reflects a heterogeneity in the methodology, analysis and conclusions of different works, which leads to ambiguity in their clinical use. This review sought to identify the primary methodologies employed for recording cVEPs. Furthermore cVEP maturation and application in understanding the function of the chromatic system under healthy and diseased conditions are reviewed. We first briefly describe the physiology of normal colour vision, before describing the methodologies and historical developments which have led to our understanding of cVEPs. We thereafter describe the expected maturation of the cVEP, followed by reviewing their application in several disorders: congenital colour vision deficiencies, retinal disease, glaucoma, optic nerve and neurological disorders, diabetes, amblyopia and dyslexia. We finalise the review with recommendations for testing and future directions.\n",

            "Article ID: 38761667, Title: Effect of pregnancy on isolation efficiency and in vitro proliferation of equine peripheral-blood derived mesenchymal stromal cells., Abstract: Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have regenerative and immunomodulatory potential and may be used to treat injured tissues. Pregnancy has been associated with increased MSCs in the peripheral circulation in multiple species, but to date, there are no reports on this matter in horses. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of pregnancy on isolation efficiency and proliferation capacity of equine MSCs derived from the peripheral blood (PB) of mares. Venous blood samples were collected at the 11th month of gestation and 1 month after delivery from clinically healthy Arabian mares that presented normal pregnancies. Blood samples were processed for in vitro cellular culture and hormonal and metabolic profiles. MSCs were isolated and characterized by trilineage differentiation potential, immunophenotyping, analyzed by gene sequencing and proliferation assays. The isolation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of pregnant mares were associated with higher isolation efficiency and proliferative capacity of MSCs derived from peripheral blood (PB-MSCs) recovered pre-partum than those isolated post-partum. Although fetal gender, parity, 5&#x3b1;-reduced pregnanes, insulin, and cortisol were shown to affect cellular proliferation, individual factors and the small population studied must be considered. This study suggests that PB-MSCs from pregnant mares could be a valuable alternative source of MSCs for therapeutic purposes.\n",

This study aimed to assess the nutraceutical effects of environmentally clean extracts from Rosmarinus officinalis and Gongolaria abies-marina (formerly Cystoseira abies-marina (Phaeophyceae)) on the metabolic profile of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. We conducted untargeted LC-QTOF-MS metabolic profiling on six groups of rats: three diabetic groups receiving either a placebo, R. officinalis, or G. abies-marina extracts, and three corresponding control groups. The metabolic analysis revealed significant alterations in the levels of various glycerophospholipids, sterol lipids, and fatty acyls. Both extracts influenced the metabolic profile, partially mitigating diabetes-induced changes. Notably, G. abies-marina extract had a more pronounced impact on the animals' metabolic profiles compared to R. officinalis. In conclusion, our findings suggest that environmentally clean extracts from R. officinalis and G. abies-marina possess nutraceutical potential, as they were able to modulate the metabolic profile in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. G. abies-marina extract exhibited a more substantial effect on metabolic alterations induced by diabetes compared to R. officinalis. These results warrant further exploration of these plant extracts for their potential in managing diabetes-related metabolic disturbances.\n",

            "Article ID: 38761410, Title: The landscape of etiological patterns of hepatocellular carcinoma and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma in Thailand., Abstract: Thailand is among countries with the highest global incidence and mortality rates of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA). While viral hepatitis and liver fluke infections have been associated with HCC and iCCA, respectively, other environmental risk factors, overall risk factor commonality and combinatorial roles, and effects on survival have not been systematically examined. We conducted a TIGER-LC consortium-based population study covering all high-incidence areas of both malignancies across Thailand: 837 HCC, 1474 iCCA, and 1112 controls (2011-2019) were comprehensively queried on lifelong environmental exposures, lifestyle, and medical history. Multivariate logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards analyses were used to evaluate risk factors and associated survival patterns. Our models identified shared risk factors between HCC and iCCA, such as viral hepatitis infection, liver fluke infection, and diabetes, including novel and shared associations of agricultural pesticide exposure (OR range of 1.50; 95% CI: 1.06-2.11 to 2.91; 95% CI: 1.82-4.63) along with vulnerable sources of drinking water. Most patients had multiple risk factors, magnifying their risk considerably. Patients with lower risk levels had better survival in both HCC (HR 0.78; 95% CI: 0.64-0.96) and iCCA (HR 0.84; 95% CI: 0.70-0.99). Risk factor co-exposures and their common associations with HCC and iCCA in Thailand emphasize the importance for future prevention and control measures, especially in its large agricultural sector. The observed mortality patterns suggest ways to stratify patients for anticipated survivorship and develop plans to support medical care of longer-term survivors, including behavioral changes to reduce exposures.\n",

            "Article ID: 38761287, Title: Everolimus alleviates CD4(+) T cell inflammation by regulating autophagy and cellular redox homeostasis., Abstract: Aging is associated with the onset and progression of multiple diseases, which limit health span. Chronic low-grade inflammation in the absence of overt infection is considered the simmering source that triggers age-associated diseases. Failure of many cellular processes during aging is mechanistically linked to inflammation; however, the overall decline in the cellular homeostasis mechanism of autophagy has emerged as one of the top and significant inducers of inflammation during aging, frequently known as inflammaging. Thus, physiological or pharmacological interventions aimed at improving autophagy are considered geroprotective. Rapamycin analogs (rapalogs) are known for their ability to inhibit mTOR and thus regulate autophagy. This study assessed the efficacy of everolimus, a rapalog, in regulating inflammatory cytokine production in T cells from older adults. CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from older adults were treated with a physiological dose of everolimus (0.01&#xa0;&#xb5;M), and indices of autophagy and inflammation were assessed to gain a mechanistic understanding of the effect of everolimus on inflammation. Everolimus (Ever) upregulated autophagy and broadly alleviated inflammatory cytokines produced by multiple T cell subsets. Everolimus's ability to alleviate the cytokines produced by Th17 subsets of T cells, such as IL-17A and IL-17F, was dependent on autophagy and antioxidant signaling pathways. Repurposing the antineoplastic drug everolimus for curbing inflammaging is promising, given the drug's ability to restore multiple cellular homeostasis mechanisms.\n",

            "Article ID: 38761257, Title: Bone metabolism in diabetes: a clinician's guide to understanding the bone-glucose interplay., Abstract: Skeletal fragility is an increasingly recognised, but poorly understood, complication of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Fracture risk varies according to skeletal site and diabetes-related characteristics. Post-fracture outcomes, including mortality risk, are worse in those with diabetes, placing these people at significant risk. Each fracture therefore represents a sentinel event that warrants targeted management. However, diabetes is a very heterogeneous condition with complex interactions between multiple co-existing, and highly correlated, factors that preclude a clear assessment of the independent clinical markers and pathophysiological drivers for diabetic osteopathy. Additionally, fracture risk calculators and routinely used clinical bone measurements generally underestimate fracture risk in people with diabetes. In the absence of dedicated prospective studies including detailed bone and metabolic characteristics, optimal management centres around selecting treatments that minimise skeletal and metabolic harm. This review summarises the clinical landscape of diabetic osteopathy and outlines the interplay between metabolic and skeletal health. The underlying pathophysiology of skeletal fragility in diabetes and a rationale for considering a diabetes-based paradigm in assessing and managing diabetic bone disease will be discussed.\n",

            "Article ID: 38761203, Title: Identification of high-performing antibodies for the reliable detection of Tau proteoforms by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry., Abstract: Antibodies are essential research tools whose performance directly impacts research conclusions and reproducibility. Owing to its central role in Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, hundreds of distinct antibody clones have been developed against the microtubule-associated protein Tau and its multiple proteoforms. Despite this breadth of offer, limited understanding of their performance and poor antibody selectivity have hindered research progress. Here, we validate a large panel of Tau antibodies by Western blot (79 reagents) and immunohistochemistry (35 reagents). We address the reagents' ability to detect the target proteoform, selectivity, the impact of protein phosphorylation on antibody binding and performance in human brain samples. While most antibodies detected Tau at high levels, many failed to detect it at lower, endogenous levels. By WB, non-selective binding to other proteins affected over half of the antibodies tested, with several cross-reacting with the related MAP2 protein, whereas the \"oligomeric Tau\" T22 antibody reacted with monomeric Tau by WB, thus calling into question its specificity to Tau oligomers. Despite the presumption that \"total\" Tau antibodies are agnostic to post-translational modifications, we found that phosphorylation partially inhibits binding for many such antibodies, including the popular Tau-5 clone. We further combine high-sensitivity reagents, mass-spectrometry proteomics and cDNA sequencing to demonstrate that presumptive Tau \"knockout\" human cells continue to express residual protein arising through exon skipping, providing evidence of previously unappreciated gene plasticity. Finally, probing of human brain samples with a large panel of antibodies revealed the presence of C-term-truncated versions of all main Tau brain isoforms in both control and tauopathy donors. Ultimately, we identify a validated panel of Tau antibodies that can be employed in Western blotting and/or immunohistochemistry to reliably detect even low levels of Tau expression with high selectivity. This work represents an extensive resource that will enable the re-interpretation of published data, improve reproducibility in Tau research, and overall accelerate scientific progress.\n",

            "Article ID: 38761087, Title: The mediating role of kynurenine pathway metabolites on the relationship between inflammation and muscle mass in oldest-old men., Abstract: Tryptophan (TRP) metabolites along the kynurenine (KYN) pathway (KP) have been found to influence muscle. Pro-inflammatory cytokines are known to stimulate the degradation of TRP down the KP. Given that both inflammation and KP metabolites have been connected with loss of muscle, we assessed the potential mediating role of KP metabolites on inflammation and muscle mass in older men. 505 men (85.0&#xb1;4.2yrs) from the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men cohort study with measured D3-creatine dilution (D3Cr) muscle mass, KP metabolites, and inflammation markers (C-reactive protein (CRP), alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) and a subsample (n=305) with interleukin (IL-6, IL-1&#x3b2;, IL-17A) and tumor necrosis factor-&#x3b1; (TNF-&#x3b1;)) were included in the analysis. KP metabolites and inflammatory markers were measured using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and immunoassays, respectively. 23-92% of the inverse relationship between inflammatory markers and D3Cr muscle mass was mediated by KP metabolites (indirect effect p&lt;0.05). 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (3-HAA), quinolinic acid (QA), TRP, xanthurenic acid (XA), KYN/TRP, 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-HK)/3-HAA, QA/3-HAA, and nicotinamide (NAM)/QA mediated the AGP relationship. 3-HAA, QA, KYN/TRP, 3-HK/XA, HKr ratio, 3-HK/3-HAA, QA/3-HAA, and NAM/QA mediated the CRP. KYN/TRP, 3-HK/XA, and NAM/QA explained the relationship for IL-6 and 3-HK/XA and QA/3-HAA for TNF-&#x3b1;. No mediation effect was observed for the other cytokines (indirect effect p&gt;0.05). KP metabolites, particularly higher ratios of KYN/TRP, 3-HK/XA, 3-HK/3-HAA, QA/3-HAA and a lower ratio of NAM/QA, mediated the relationship between inflammation and low muscle mass. Our preliminary cross-sectional data suggest that interventions to alter D3Cr muscle mass may focus on KP metabolites rather than inflammation per se.\n",

Here, we show that hepatic phospho-active ACLY correlates with overweight and Model for End-stage Liver Disease score in humans. Wild-type mice treated chronically with the ACLY inhibitor potassium hydroxycitrate exhibited delayed early mortality. In AML12 hepatocyte cultures, the ACLY inhibitors potassium hydroxycitrate, SB-204990, and bempedoic acid fostered lipid accumulation, which was also observed in the liver of healthy-fed mice treated with potassium hydroxycitrate. Analysis of soleus tissue indicated that potassium hydroxycitrate produced the modulation of wound healing processes. In&#xa0;vivo, potassium hydroxycitrate modulated locomotor function toward increased wire hang performance and reduced rotarod performance in healthy-fed mice, and improved locomotion in mice exposed to cardiotoxin-induced muscle atrophy. Our findings implicate ACLY and ACLY inhibitors in different aspects of aging and muscle regeneration.\n",

In recent years, reports have emphasized the effects of BMP10 on myocardial apoptosis, fibrosis and immune response, as well as its synergistic effects with BMP9 in vascular endothelium and role in endothelial dysfunction. We believe that concentrating on this aspect of the study will enhance our knowledge of the pathogenesis of diabetes and the cardiovascular field. However, there have been no reports of any reviews discussing the role of BMP10 in diabetes and cardiovascular disease. In addition, the exact pathogenesis of diabetic cardiomyopathy is not fully understood, including myocardial energy metabolism disorders, microvascular changes, abnormal apoptosis of cardiomyocytes, collagen structural changes and myocardial fibrosis, all of which cause cardiac function impairment directly or indirectly and interact with one another. This review summarizes the research results of BMP10 in cardiac development, endothelial function and cardiovascular disease in an effort to generate new ideas for future research into diabetic cardiomyopathy.\n",

            "Article ID: 38760808, Title: sEMG-based automatic characterization of swallowed materials., Abstract: Monitoring of ingestive activities is critically important for managing the health and wellness of individuals with various health conditions, including the elderly, diabetics, and individuals seeking better weight control. Monitoring swallowing events can be an ideal surrogate for developing streamlined methods for effective monitoring and quantification of eating or drinking events. Swallowing is an essential process for maintaining life. This seemingly simple process is the result of coordinated actions of several muscles and nerves in a complex fashion. In this study, we introduce automated methods for the detection and quantification of various eating and drinking activities. Wireless surface electromyography (sEMG) was used to detect chewing and swallowing from sEMG signals obtained from the sternocleidomastoid muscle, in addition to signals obtained from a wrist-mounted IMU sensor. A total of 4675&#xa0;swallows were collected from 55&#xa0;participants in the study. Multiple methods were employed to estimate bolus volumes in the case of fluid intake, including regression and classification models. Among the tested models, neural networks-based regression achieved an R<sup>2</sup> of 0.88 and a root mean squared error of 0.2 (minimum bolus volume was 10&#xa0;ml). Convolutional neural networks-based classification (when considering each bolus volume as a separate class) achieved an accuracy of over 99% using random cross-validation and around 66% using cross-subject validation. Multiple classification methods were also used for solid bolus type detection, including SVM and decision trees (DT), which achieved an accuracy above 99% with random validation and above 94% in cross-subject validation. Finally, regression models with both random and cross-subject validation were used for estimating the solid bolus volume with an R<sup>2</sup> value that approached 1 and root mean squared error values as low as 0.00037 (minimum solid bolus weight was 3&#xa0;gm). These reported results lay the foundation for a cost-effective and non-invasive method for monitoring swallowing activities which can be extremely beneficial in managing various chronic health conditions, such as diabetes and obesity.\n",

            "Article ID: 38760578, Title: The relationship between low prolactin and type 2 diabetes., Abstract: Prolactin (PRL) is secreted throughout life in men and women. At elevated levels, its physiological role in pregnancy and lactation, and pathological effects, are well known. However clinical implications of low circulating PRL are not well established. We conducted a meta-analysis to examine the relationship between low PRL levels and type 2 diabetes. Five papers included cross-sectional studies comprising 8,720 men (mean age range 51.4-60&#xa0;years) and 3,429 women (49.5-61.6&#xa0;years), and four papers included cohort studies comprising 2,948 men (52.1-60.0&#xa0;years) and 3,203 women (49.2-60.1&#xa0;years). Individuals with pregnancy, lactation and hyperprolactinemia, drugs known to alter circulating PRL levels, or pituitary diseases had been excluded. Although most studies used quartiles to categorize PRL groups for analysis, PRL cut-off values (all measured by chemiluminescence immunoassay) were variably defined between studies: the lowest PRL quartiles ranged from 3.6&#xa0;ng/ml to 7.2&#xa0;ng/ml in men and between 4.5&#xa0;ng/ml to 8&#xa0;ng/ml in women; and the highest PRL quartiles ranged from 6.9&#xa0;ng/ml to 13&#xa0;ng/ml in men and 9.6&#xa0;ng/ml to 15.8&#xa0;ng/ml in women. Type 2 diabetes was defined variably using self-reported physician's diagnosis, fasting blood glucose, oral glucose tolerance test or glycated hemoglobin (HbA<sub>1C</sub>). In cross-sectional studies, compared to individuals in the highest PRL groups (reference), those in the lowest PRL groups had greater risk of type 2 diabetes both in men: odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.86 (1.56-2.22) and in women: OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;2.15 (1.63-2.85). In cohort studies, women showed a significant association between low PRL and type 2 diabetes: OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.52 (1.02-2.28) but not men: OR&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.44 (0.46-4.57). Relatively low heterogeneity was observed (I<sup>2</sup>&#x2009;=&#x2009;25-38.4%) for cross-sectional studies, but higher for cohort studies (I<sup>2</sup>&#x2009;=&#x2009;52.8-79.7%). In conclusion, low PRL is associated with type 2 diabetes, but discrepancy between men and women in the relationship within cohort studies requires further research.\n",

            "Article ID: 38760566, Title: Bidirectional epigenetic editing reveals hierarchies in gene regulation., Abstract: CRISPR perturbation methods are limited in their ability to study non-coding elements and genetic interactions. In this study, we developed a system for bidirectional epigenetic editing, called CRISPRai, in which we apply activating (CRISPRa) and repressive (CRISPRi) perturbations to two loci simultaneously in the same cell. We developed CRISPRai Perturb-seq by coupling dual perturbation gRNA detection with single-cell RNA sequencing, enabling study of pooled perturbations in a mixed single-cell population. We applied this platform to study the genetic interaction between two hematopoietic lineage transcription factors, SPI1 and GATA1, and discovered novel characteristics of their co-regulation on downstream target genes, including differences in SPI1 and GATA1 occupancy at genes that are regulated through different modes. We also studied the regulatory landscape of IL2 (interleukin-2) in Jurkat T cells, primary T cells and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells and elucidated mechanisms of enhancer-mediated IL2 gene regulation. CRISPRai facilitates investigation of context-specific genetic interactions, provides new insights into gene regulation and will enable exploration of non-coding disease-associated variants.\n",

            "Article ID: 38760482, Title: AMPK as a mediator of tissue preservation: time for a shift in dogma?, Abstract: Ground-breaking discoveries have established 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) as a central sensor of metabolic stress in cells and tissues. AMPK is activated through cellular starvation, exercise and drugs by either directly or indirectly affecting the intracellular AMP (or ADP) to ATP ratio. In turn, AMPK regulates multiple processes of cell metabolism, such as the maintenance of cellular ATP levels, via the regulation of fatty acid oxidation, glucose uptake, glycolysis, autophagy, mitochondrial biogenesis and degradation, and insulin sensitivity. Moreover, AMPK inhibits anabolic processes, such as lipogenesis and protein synthesis. These findings support the notion that AMPK is a crucial regulator of cell catabolism. However, studies have revealed that AMPK's role in cell homeostasis might not be as unidirectional as originally thought. This Review explores emerging evidence for AMPK as a promoter of cell survival and an enhancer of anabolic capacity in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue during catabolic crises. We discuss AMPK-activating interventions for tissue preservation during tissue wasting in cancer-associated cachexia and explore the clinical potential of AMPK activation in wasting conditions. Overall, we provide arguments that call for a shift in the current dogma of AMPK as a mere regulator of cell catabolism, concluding that AMPK has an unexpected role in tissue preservation.\n",

One hundred twenty-three (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;123) women with FMS completed demographic (age, height, weight), clinical (years with pain, intensity of pain at rest and during daily living activities), functional (quality of life, physical function), sensory-related (sensitization-associated and neuropathic-associated symptoms), psychophysical (pressure pain thresholds), psychological (sleep quality, depressive and anxiety level) and cognitive (pain catastrophizing, kinesiophobia) variables. Those three genotypes of the OPRM1 rs1799971, HTR1B rs6296 and COMT rs4680 single nucleotide polymorphisms were obtained by polymerase chain reactions from no-stimulated whole saliva collection. No significant differences in demographic, clinical, functional, sensory-related, psychophysical, psychological and cognitive variables according to OPRM1 rs1799971, HTR1B rs6296 or COMT rs4680 genotype were identified in our sample of women with FMS. A multilevel analysis did not either reveal any significant gene-to-gene interaction between OPRM1 rs1799971 x HTR1B rs6296, OPRM1 rs1799971 x COMT rs4680 and HTR1B rs6296 x COMT rs4680 for any of the investigated outcomes. This study revealed that three single nucleotide polymorphisms, OPRM1 rs1799971, HTR1B rs6296 or COMT rs4680, mostly associated with chronic pain were not involved in phenotyping features of FMS. Potential gene-to-gene interaction and their association with clinical phenotype in women with FMS should be further investigated in future studies including large sample sizes.\n",

            "Article ID: 38760452, Title: Comparison of HIIT and MICT and further detraining on metabolic syndrome and asprosin signaling pathway in metabolic syndrome model of rats., Abstract: Physical activity promotes various metabolic benefits by balancing pro and anti-inflammatory adipokines. Recent studies suggest that asprosin might be involved in progression of metabolic syndrome (MetS), however, the underlying mechanisms have not been understood yet. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of high-intensity interval training (HIIT), moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT), and further detraining on MetS indices, insulin resistance, serum and the liver levels of asprosin, and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway in menopause-induced MetS model of rats. A total of 64 Wistar rats were used in this study and divided into eight groups: Sham1, OVX1 (ovariectomized), Sham2, OVX2, OVX&#x2009;+&#x2009;HIIT, OVX&#x2009;+&#x2009;MICT, OVX&#x2009;+&#x2009;HIIT&#x2009;+&#x2009;Det (detraining), and OVX&#x2009;+&#x2009;MICT&#x2009;+&#x2009;Det. Animals performed the protocols, and then serum concentrations of asprosin, TNF-&#x3b1;, insulin, fasting blood glucose, and lipid profiles (TC, LDL, TG, and HDL) were assessed. Additionally, the liver expression of asprosin, AMPK, and P-AMPK was measured by western blotting.&#xa0;Both HIIT and MICT caused a significant decrease in weight, waist circumference, BMI (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001), and serum levels of glucose, insulin, asprosin (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001), triglyceride, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and TNF-&#x3b1; (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001), but an increase in the liver AMPK, P-AMPK, and P-AMPK/AMPK (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001), compared with OVX2 noexercised group. MICT was superior to HIIT in reducing serum asprosin, TNF-a, TG, LDL (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001), insulin, fasting blood glucose, HOMA-IR, and QUEKI index (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001), but an increase in the liver AMPK, and p-AMPK (P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001). Although after two months of de-training almost all indices returned to the pre exercise values (P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05). The findings suggest that MICT effectively alleviates MetS induced by menopause, at least partly through the activation of liver signaling of P-AMPK and the reduction of asprosin and TNF-&#x3b1;. These results have practical implications for the development of exercise interventions targeting MetS in menopausal individuals, emphasizing the potential benefits of MICT in mitigating MetS-related complications.\n",

Using an interviewer-led questionnaire, we surveyed 623 participants aged 7-18 from the South East Asia Community Observatory (SEACO). Anthropometric and blood pressure data were collected from all participants, while a subset (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;162) provided blood samples for biomarker analysis, including fasting blood glucose (FBG), total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Metabolic syndrome was determined using the International Diabetes Federation's Definition of Metabolic Syndrome in Children and Adolescents. Most participants were Malay (66.8%), with a median household income of MYR1,500 and a balanced sex distribution. Cereals, processed foods, beverages, fruits, and vegetables were commonly consumed. Obesity and abdominal obesity were prevalent, affecting more than a third of participants. Adherence to dietary recommendations was generally poor (ranging from 19.9 to 58.1%) and varied across age, sex, and ethnicity. Notably, some food groups displayed unexpected associations with health markers; for instance, fruit consumption was linked to abdominal obesity in children (abdominal obesity vs. normal: 2.4 servings/day vs. 1.6 servings/day). These findings emphasise the necessity of longitudinal studies to explore the complex relationship between diet and long-term health outcomes, including cardiometabolic diseases, while acknowledging the unique challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic on data collection and analysis.\n",

            "Article ID: 38760435, Title: Mortality outcomes in diabetic metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease: non-obese versus obese individuals., Abstract: The difference in the survival of obese patients and normal-weight/lean patients with diabetic MAFLD remains unclear. Therefore, we aimed to describe the long-term survival of individuals with diabetic MAFLD and overweight/obesity (OT2M), diabetic MAFLD with lean/normal weight (LT2M), MAFLD with overweight/obesity and without T2DM (OM), and MAFLD with lean/normal weight and without T2DM (LM). Using the NHANESIII database, participants with MAFLD were divided into four groups. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for all-cause, cardiovascular disease (CVD)-related, and cancer-related mortalities for different MAFLD subtypes were evaluated using Cox proportional hazards models. Of the 3539 participants, 1618 participants (42.61%) died during a mean follow-up period of 274.41&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;2.35&#xa0;months.

All-cause and CVD mortality rates in LT2M and OT2M patients were higher than those in OM patients. Patients with concurrent T2DM and MAFLD should be screened, regardless of the presence of obesity.\n",

Conventional diagnostic tools and standard treatment regimens have only managed to achieve limited success in the management of patients suspected of glioblastoma. Extracellular vesicles are an emerging liquid biopsy tool that has shown great promise in resolving the limitations presented by the heterogeneous nature of glioblastoma. Here we discuss the contrasting yet interdependent dual role of extracellular vesicles as communication agents that contribute to the progression of glioblastoma by creating a heterogeneous microenvironment and as a liquid biopsy tool providing an opportunity to accurately identify the disease severity and progression.\n",

            "Article ID: 38760424, Title: Association of major and minor ECG abnormalities with traditional cardiovascular risk factors in the general population: a large scale study., Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) can be determined and quantified using the electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis. Identification of the risk factors associated with ECG abnormalities may advise prevention approaches to decrease CVD burden. In this study we aimed to investigate the association between CVD risk factors and minor and major ECG abnormalities in a general Iranian adult population. This study was conducted in 2010 and covered a population of 9035 males and females aged 35 to 65 years recruiting from the phase I of Mashhad Stroke and Heart Atherosclerotic Disorder (MASHAD) cohort study. The participants were drawn by a stratified cluster random sampling technique. The Bivariate and multinomial logistic regression analysis were conducted considering gender stratification to explore the association of ECG abnormalities with traditional cardiovascular risk factors. There was a significant association between minor and major ECG abnormalities and hypertension (HTN), type 2 diabetes (T2DM), smoking, and physical activity (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.005). There was a significant trend, in both genders, for increasing major abnormalities as the number of CVD risk factors increased. But, only in women, the minor abnormalities increase in frequency as the number of CVD risk factors increased. The results of multinomial logistic regression showed that men with HTN [ARRR&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.25, 95% CI 0.99, 1.57] and T2DM [ARRR&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.31, 95% CI 0.99, 1.74] had the highest likelihood to have major abnormalities, although these are not statistically significant. For women, those with HTN had the highest likelihood to have major [ARRR&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.36, 95% CI 1.13, 1.63] and minor [ARRR&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.35, 95% CI 1.15, 1.58] abnormalities. Also, women aged&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;60 years were more likely to have major [ARRR&#x2009;=&#x2009;2.01, 95% CI 1.49, 2.74] and minor [ARRR&#x2009;=&#x2009;1.59, 95% CI 1.20, 2.10] abnormalities compared to women aged&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;45 years. Age and HTN were significantly associated with major and minor ECG abnormalities in women, and, on the other hand, HTN and T2DM were associated with major abnormalities in men. Taken together, these findings suggest that healthcare providers should advise preventive approaches to the asymptomatic adults with both major and minor electrocardiographic abnormalities that may predict cardiovascular risk.\n",

Clinical and self-reported periodontitis, along with sociodemographic data, were collected from 197 adults. Akaike information criterion models were developed to identify periodontitis, and nomograms developed based on its regression coefficients. The discriminatory capability was evaluated by receiver-operating characteristic curves. Decision curve analysis was performed. Smoking [OR 3.69 (95%CI 1.89, 7.21)], poor/fair self-rated oral health [OR 6.62 (95%CI 3.23, 13.56)], previous periodontal treatment [OR 9.47 (95%CI 4.02, 22.25)], and tooth loss [OR 4.96 (95%CI 2.47, 9.97)], determined higher probability of having \"Moderate/Severe Periodontitis\". Age [OR 1.08 (95%CI 1.05, 1.12)], low educational level [OR 1.65 (95%CI 1.34, 2.23)], poor/fair self-rated oral health [OR 3.57 (95%CI 1.82, 6.99)], and previous periodontal treatment [OR 6.66 (95%CI 2.83, 15.68)] determined higher probability for \"Any Periodontitis\". Both nomograms showed excellent discriminatory capability (AUC of 0.83 (95%CI 0.75, 0.91) and 0.81 (95% CI 0.74, 0.88), good calibration, and slight overestimation of high risk and underestimation of low risk. Hence, our nomograms could help identify periodontitis among adults in Denmark.\n",

OKV-119 is an investigational drug delivery system that is being developed for the long-term delivery of the GLP-1RA exenatide to feline patients. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the drug release characteristics of subcutaneous OKV-119 implants configured to release exenatide for 84 days. Following a 7-day acclimation period, five purpose-bred cats were implanted with OKV-119 protypes and observed for a 112-day study period. Food intake, weekly plasma exenatide concentrations and body weight were measured. Exenatide plasma concentrations were detected at the first measured timepoint (Day 7) and maintained above baseline for over 84 Days. Over the first 28 days, reduced caloric intake and a reduction in body weight were observed in four of five cats. In these cats, a body weight reduction of at least 5% was maintained throughout the 112-day study period. This study demonstrates that a single OKV-119 implant can deliver the GLP-1RA exenatide for a months long duration. Results suggest that exposure to exenatide plasma concentrations ranging from 1.5 ng/ml to 4 ng/ml are sufficient for inducing weight loss in cats.\n"
