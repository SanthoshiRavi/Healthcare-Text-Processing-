            "Abstract: Beneficial weight-loss properties of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) in obese people, with corresponding improvements in cardiometabolic risk factors, are well established. OKV-119 is an investigational drug delivery system that is being developed for the long-term delivery of the GLP-1RA exenatide to feline patients. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the drug release characteristics of subcutaneous OKV-119 implants configured to release exenatide for 84 days. Following a 7-day acclimation period, five purpose-bred cats were implanted with OKV-119 protypes and observed for a 112-day study period. Food intake, weekly plasma exenatide concentrations and body weight were measured. Exenatide plasma concentrations were detected at the first measured timepoint (Day 7) and maintained above baseline for over 84 Days. Over the first 28 days, reduced caloric intake and a reduction in body weight were observed in four of five cats. In these cats, a body weight reduction of at least 5% was maintained throughout the 112-day study period. This study demonstrates that a single OKV-119 implant can deliver the GLP-1RA exenatide for a months long duration. Results suggest that exposure to exenatide plasma concentrations ranging from 1.5 ng/ml to 4 ng/ml are sufficient for inducing weight loss in cats.\n",

            "Abstract: Adipogenesis significantly contributes to healthy adipose tissue expansion in obesity. Increasing adipocyte number or function to alleviate adipose tissue overload could serve as a therapeutic strategy for both lipodystrophy and obesity-related metabolic syndrome. Inorganic pyrophosphatase (PPA1) is an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of pyrophosphate (PPi) and is involved in many biochemical reactions, but its function in adipose tissue has not been studied previously. In this study, we demonstrated that adipose-specific PPA1 knockout (PPA1<sup>AKO</sup>) mice showed lipodystrophy and spontaneously developed hepatic steatosis and severe insulin resistance under normal chow diet feeding. PPA1 deficiency suppressed the differentiation of primary adipocyte precursors and 3T3-L1 cells. Notably, PPA1 overexpression can restore inhibited adipogenesis in preadipocytes isolated from db/db mice and type 2 diabetes patients. Mechanistic studies have revealed that PPA1 acts as a positive regulator of early adipocyte differentiation by promoting CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteinβ and δ (C/EBPβ and δ) protein stability. Moreover, the function of PPA1 in adipogenesis is independent of its PPi catalytic activity. Collectively, our in vivo and in vitro findings demonstrated that PPA1 is a novel critical upstream regulator of adipogenesis, controlling adipose tissue development and whole-body metabolic homeostasis.\n",

            "Abstract: The hypothalamus is the key regulator for energy homeostasis and is functionally connected to striatal and cortical regions vital for the inhibitory control of appetite. Hence, the ability to non-invasively modulate the hypothalamus network could open new ways for the treatment of metabolic diseases. Here, we tested a novel method for network-targeted transcranial direct current stimulation (net-tDCS) to influence the excitability of brain regions involved in the control of appetite. Based on the resting-state functional connectivity map of the hypothalamus, a 12-channel net-tDCS protocol was generated (Neuroelectrics Starstim system), which included anodal, cathodal and sham stimulation. Ten participants with overweight or obesity were enrolled in a sham-controlled, crossover study. During stimulation or sham control, participants completed a stop-signal task to measure inhibitory control. Overall, stimulation was well tolerated. Anodal net-tDCS resulted in faster stop signal reaction time (SSRT) compared to sham (p = 0.039) and cathodal net-tDCS (p = 0.042). Baseline functional connectivity of the target network correlated with SSRT after anodal compared to sham stimulation (p = 0.016). These preliminary data indicate that modulating hypothalamus functional network connectivity via net-tDCS may result in improved inhibitory control. Further studies need to evaluate the effects on eating behavior and metabolism.\n",

            "Abstract: Although self-reported health outcomes are of importance, attempts to validate a clinical applicable instrument (e.g., nomogram) combining sociodemographic and self-reported information on periodontitis have yet to be performed to identify periodontitis cases. Clinical and self-reported periodontitis, along with sociodemographic data, were collected from 197 adults. Akaike information criterion models were developed to identify periodontitis, and nomograms developed based on its regression coefficients. The discriminatory capability was evaluated by receiver-operating characteristic curves. Decision curve analysis was performed. Smoking [OR 3.69 (95%CI 1.89, 7.21)], poor/fair self-rated oral health [OR 6.62 (95%CI 3.23, 13.56)], previous periodontal treatment [OR 9.47 (95%CI 4.02, 22.25)], and tooth loss [OR 4.96 (95%CI 2.47, 9.97)], determined higher probability of having \"Moderate/Severe Periodontitis\". Age [OR 1.08 (95%CI 1.05, 1.12)], low educational level [OR 1.65 (95%CI 1.34, 2.23)], poor/fair self-rated oral health [OR 3.57 (95%CI 1.82, 6.99)], and previous periodontal treatment [OR 6.66 (95%CI 2.83, 15.68)] determined higher probability for \"Any Periodontitis\". Both nomograms showed excellent discriminatory capability (AUC of 0.83 (95%CI 0.75, 0.91) and 0.81 (95% CI 0.74, 0.88), good calibration, and slight overestimation of high risk and underestimation of low risk. Hence, our nomograms could help identify periodontitis among adults in Denmark.\n",
