            "ID: 38768161, Title: Design of a bi-directional methodology for automated assessment of compliance to continuous application of clinical guidelines, and its evaluation in the type 2 diabetes domain., Abstract: We introduce a new approach for automated guideline-based-care quality assessment, the bidirectional knowledge-based assessment of compliance (BiKBAC) method, and the DiscovErr system, which implements it. Our methodology compares the guideline's Asbru-based formal representation, including its intentions, with the longitudinal medical record, using a top-down and bottom-up approach. Partial matches are resolved using fuzzy temporal logic. The system was evaluated in the type 2 Diabetes management domain, comparing it to three expert clinicians, including two diabetes experts. The system and the experts commented on the management of 10 patients, randomly selected from 2,000 diabetes patients. On average, each record spanned 5.23 years; the data included 1,584 medical transactions. The system provided 279 comments. The experts made 181 different unique comments. The completeness (recall) of the system was 91% when the gold standard was comments made by at least two of the three experts, and 98%, compared to comments made by all three experts. The experts also assessed all of the 114 medication-therapy-related comments, and a random 35% of the 165 tests-and-monitoring-related comments. The system's correctness (precision) was 81%, compared to comments judged as correct by both diabetes experts, and 91%, compared to comments judged as correct by one diabetes expert and at least as partially correct by the other. 89% of the comments were judged as important by both diabetes experts, 8% were judged as important by one expert, and 3% were judged as less important by both experts. Adding the validated system comments to the experts' comments, the completeness scores of the experts were 75%, 60%, and 55%; the expert correctness scores were respectively 99%, 91%, and 88%. Thus, the system could be ranked first in completeness and second in correctness. We conclude that systems such as DiscovErr can effectively assess the quality of continuous guideline-based care.\n",
            "ID: 38768121, Title: Exploring the path to optimal diabetes care by unravelling the contextual factors affecting access, utilisation, and quality of primary health care in West Africa: A scoping review protocol., Abstract: The prevalence of diabetes in West Africa is increasing, posing a major public health threat. An estimated 24 million Africans have diabetes, with rates in West Africa around 2-6% and projected to rise 129% by 2045 according to the WHO. Over 90% of cases are Type 2 diabetes (IDF, World Bank). As diabetes is ambulatory care sensitive, good primary care is crucial to reduce complications and mortality. However, research on factors influencing diabetes primary care access, utilisation and quality in West Africa remains limited despite growing disease burden. While research has emphasised diabetes prevalence and risk factors in West Africa, there remains limited evidence on contextual influences on primary care. This scoping review aims to address these evidence gaps. Using the established methodology by Arksey and O'Malley, this scoping review will undergo six stages. The review will adopt the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Extension for Scoping Review (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines to ensure methodological rigour. We will search four electronic databases and search through grey literature sources to thoroughly explore the topic. The identified articles will undergo thorough screening. We will collect data using a standardised data extraction form that covers study characteristics, population demographics, and study methods. The study will identify key themes and sub-themes related to primary healthcare access, utilisation, and quality. We will then analyse and summarise the data using a narrative synthesis approach. The findings and conclusive report will be finished and sent to a peer-reviewed publication within six months. This review protocol aims to systematically examine and assess the factors that impact the access, utilisation, and standard of primary healthcare services for diabetes in West Africa.\n",
            "ID: 38768080, Title: A national audit of facilities, human and material resources for the comprehensive management of diabetes in Ghana-A 2023 update., Abstract: The human and material resources as well as the systems for managing diabetes in Africa are inadequate. This study or needs assessment, aimed at updating the human and material resources, identifying the gaps and unmet needs for comprehensive diabetes care in Ghana. We conducted a national audit of 122 facilities in all 16 administrative regions of Ghana. Information obtained covered areas on personnel and multidisciplinary teams, access to medications, access to laboratory services, financing, screening services, management of diabetes complications, and availability/use of diabetes guidelines or protocols. Data was analysed using STATA version 16.1. P-values <0.05 were set as significant. Only 85(69.7%) out of the 122 surveyed facilities had a dedicated centre or service for diabetes care. Twenty-eight (23%) had trained diabetes doctors/specialists; and whilst most centres had ophthalmic nurses and dieticians, majority of them did not have trained diabetes educators (nurses), psychologists, ophthalmologists, podiatrists, and foot/vascular surgeons. Also, 13.9% had monofilaments, none could perform urine dipstick for microalbumin; 5 (4.1%) and just over 50% could perform laboratory microalbumin estimation and glycated haemoglobin, respectively. Access to and supply of human insulins was better than analogue insulin in most centres. Nearly 100% of the institutions surveyed had access to metformin and sulphonylurea with good to excellent supply in most cases, whilst access to Sodium Glucose Transporter-2 inhibitors and Glucagon-like peptide-1 analogues were low, and moderate for Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors and thiazolidinediones. Majority of the health facilities (95.1%) offered NHIS as payment mechanism for clients, whilst 68.0% and 30.3% of the patients paid for services using out-of-pocket and private insurance respectively. Fifteen facilities (12.3%) had Diabetes Support Groups in their locality and catchment areas. An urgent multisectoral collaboration, including prioritisation of resources at the facility level, to promote and achieve acceptable comprehensive diabetes care is required.\n",
            "ID: 38768058, Title: Metabolic dysregulation in obese women and the carcinogenesis of gynecological tumors: A review., Abstract: Obesity is a significant health issue associated with increased cancer risks, including gynecological malignancies. The worldwide rise in obesity rates is significantly impacting both cancer development and treatment outcomes. Adipose tissue plays a crucial role in metabolism, secreting various substances that can influence cancer formation. In obese individuals, dysfunctional adipose tissue can contribute to cancer development through inflammation, insulin resistance, hormonal changes, and abnormal cholesterol metabolism. Studies have shown a strong correlation between obesity and gynecological cancers, particularly endometrial and breast cancers. Obesity not only increases the risk of developing these cancers but is also associated with poorer outcomes. Additionally, obesity affects the perioperative management of gynecological cancers, requiring specialized care due to increased complications and resistance to therapy. Treatment strategies for managing metabolic dysregulation in patients with gynecological cancers include weight management, statin therapy, and insulin-sensitizing medications. Emerging studies suggest that interventions like intermittent fasting and caloric restriction may enhance the effectiveness of cancer treatments. Furthermore, targeting cholesterol metabolism, such as with statins or proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors, shows potential in cancer therapy. In conclusion, addressing metabolic issues, particularly obesity, is crucial in preventing and treating gynecological malignancies. Personalized approaches focusing on weight management and metabolic reprogramming may improve outcomes in these patients.\n",
            "ID: 38768051, Title: Fractures in Patients With Diabetes Mellitus: Findings From a 20-year Registry at a Single Level 1 Trauma Center., Abstract: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a risk factor of infection. Although DM has been associated with worse functional outcomes after acetabular fracture, literature regarding the effect of DM on surgical site infection and other early complications is lacking. A 20-year registry from a level 1 trauma center was queried to identify 134 patients with DM and 345 nondiabetic patients with acetabular fractures. The diabetic patient population was older (57.2 versus 43.2; P < 0.001) and had higher average body mass index (33.6 versus 29.5; P < 0.001). Eighty-three patients with DM and 270 nondiabetics were treated surgically (62% versus 78%; P < 0.001). Diabetic patients who were younger (54.6 versus 61.4; P = 0.01) with fewer comorbidities (1.7 versus 2.2; P = 0.04) were more frequently managed surgically. On univariate analysis, patients with DM more commonly developed any early infection (28.4% versus 21%; P = 0.049) but were no more likely to develop surgical site infection, or other postoperative complications. Older patient age, length of stay, baseline pulmonary disease, and concurrent abdominal injury were independent predictors of postoperative infection other than surgical site infection. Diabetics that developed infection had more comorbidities (2.4 versus 1.5; P < 0.001) and higher Injury Severity Score (24.1 versus 15.8; P = 0.003), and were more frequently insulin-dependent (72.7% versus 41%; P = 0.01). Independent of management strategy, diabetic patients were more likely to develop an infection after acetabular fracture. Insulin dependence was associated with postoperative infection on univariate analysis. Optimal selection of surgical candidates among patients with DM may limit postoperative infections.\n",
            "ID: 38767849, Title: ASSOCIATION OF MACULAR STRUCTURE WITH MICROPERIMETRY SENSITIVITY FOLLOWING VITRECTOMY FOR PROLIFERATE DIABETIC RETINOPATHY., Abstract: To evaluate macular sensitivity using microperimetry in patients with proliferate diabetic retinopathy following vitrectomy and to investigate the relationship between the sensitivity and foveal microstructures with optical coherence tomography/angiography. Eighty-four eyes of 84 patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy, who were indicated for vitrectomy, had no intraocular surgery history 3 months preoperatively, and were able to ensure fundus examination after the vitrectomy, were included. A logMAR best-corrected visual acuity, macular sensitivity of microperimetry, macular retinal thickness, and macular vessel perfusion using optical coherence tomography/angiography were examined at 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months postoperatively. The logMAR best-corrected visual acuity and mean macular sensitivity of patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy improved postoperatively (P < 0.05). There was a significant correlation between best-corrected visual acuity and mean sensitivity (P < 0.05). Postoperative mean macular sensitivity was significantly correlated with outer retinal thickness in the 0 to 6 mm macular area (P < 0.05) and also significantly correlated with deep capillary plexus perfusion (P < 0.05). Fixation stability and mean macular sensitivity did not show any correlation with glycated hemoglobin, triglyceride, serum total cholesterol, carbamide, and creatinine and duration of diabetes mellitus (P > 0.05). Postoperative mean macular sensitivity was significantly correlated with outer retinal thickness and deep capillary plexus perfusion for patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy. The authors found that the visual performance of patients can be evaluated by the outer retinal thickness and deep capillary plexus perfusion, so optical coherence tomography/angiography examination can be an important prognostic factor for visual performance in patients.Clinical Trial Registration: This trial is registered with the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (http://www.chictr.org.cn; Registration No.: ChiCTR2100043399).\n",
            "ID: 38767826, Title: Dietary Modulations in Preventing Cardiometabolic Risk in Individuals with Type 2 Diabetes., Abstract: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a complex health issue include obesity, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and chronic inflammation that increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). CVDs are of great concern in the disease progression and prognosis of T2DM. This review is a comprehensive examination of the literature on the relationship between T2DM and cardiovascular risk, nutrition-related cardiometabolic risk (CMR) factors, and impact of dietary modulations on CMR. In recent years the researches has been focus on the importance of a comprehensive treatment approach like dietary modulations to address multiple cardiovascular risk reductions, including hypertension and dyslipidemia. Modulation of dietary patterns are the most promising interventions to prevent CMR factors and T2DM via affecting the body weight, glucose control, and microbial diversity of individuals. Current evidence suggests that high-quality dietary patterns such as the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan and the Mediterranean diet is important in the metabolic control processes of T2DM with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant compounds, glucagon-like peptide agonist compounds, and intestinal microbiota changes. Nutrition plays a critical role in preventing and improving CVD outcomes in patients with T2DM. Dietary modulations should be planned considering individual differences in responses to dietary composition and nutritional changes, personal preferences, eating behaviors and gut microbiota differences.\n",
            "ID: 38767675, Title: Open questions on basal insulin therapy in T2D: a Delphi consensus., Abstract: The revolution in the therapeutic approach to type 2 diabetes (T2D) requires a rethinking of the positioning of basal insulin (BI) therapy. Given the considerable number of open questions, a group of experts was convened with the aim of providing, through a Delphi consensus method, practical guidance for doctors. A group of 6 experts developed a series of 29 statements on: the role of metabolic control in light of the most recent guidelines; BI intensification strategies: (1) add-on versus switch; (2) inertia in starting and titrating; (3) free versus fixed ratio combination; basal-bolus intensification and de-intensification strategies; second generation analogues of BI (2BI). A panel of 31 diabetologists, by accessing a dedicated website, assigned each statement a relevance score on a 9-point scale. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method was adopted to assess the existence of disagreement among participants. Panelists showed agreement for all 29 statements, of which 26 were considered relevant, one was considered not relevant and two were of uncertain relevance. Panelists agreed that the availability of new classes of drugs often allows the postponement of BI and the simplification of therapy. It remains essential to promptly initiate and titrate BI when required. BI should always, unless contraindicated, be started in addition to, and not as a replacement, for ongoing treatments with cardiorenal benefits. 2BIs should be preferred for their pharmacological profile, greater ease of self-titration and flexibility of administration. In a continuously evolving scenario, BI therapy still represents an important option in the management of T2D patients.\n",
            "ID: 38767674, Title: Assessment of genetic and clinical factors in T2D susceptibility among patients with hypertension., Abstract: Hypertension (HTN) and Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) often coexist, therefore understanding the relationship between both diseases is imperative to guide targeted prevention/therapy. This study aims to explore the relationship between HTN and T2D using genome-wide association study (GWAS) analysis and biochemical data to understand the implication of both clinical and genetic factors in these pathologies. A total of 2,876 patients were enrolled. Using GWAS and biochemical data, patients with both T2D and HTN were compared to patients with only HTN. Specificity was confirmed by testing the detected genetic variants for associations with HTN development in T2D patients, or with HTN in healthy subjects. Regression models were applied to examine the association of T2D in patients with HTN with cardiovascular risk factors. Replication was performed using UK Biobank dataset with 31,170 subjects. Data showed that females with HTN are at higher risk of developing T2D due to dyslipidemia, while males faced higher risk due to high BMI (body mass index) and family history of T2D. GWAS identified Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) linked to T2D in patients with HTN. Notably, rs7865889, rs7756992, and rs10896290 were positively associated with T2D, whereas rs12737517 yielded negative association. Three SNPs were replicated in the UK Biobank (rs10896290, rs7865889, and rs7756992). Incorporating clinical and genetic screening into risk assessment is important for the detection and prevention of T2D in patients with HTN. The detected SNPs (rs7865889, rs12737517, and rs10896290), especially the protective SNP (rs12737517), provide an opportunity for better diagnosis, prevention, and therapy of patients with T2D and HTN.\n",
            "ID: 38767646, Title: Characteristics and quality of clinical practice guidelines for diabetic kidney disease: a systematic review., Abstract: To assess the quality of Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) in the context of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) and determine whether any factors affect the quality. We searched eight databases along with five international and national organizations to develop or archive guidelines from their inception to July 2023, with an additional search of medlive.cn. And the authoritative organizations related to nephrology. CPGs and consensus statements created using direct differential diagnosis or therapy for DKD were included without language restrictions. Their quality was evaluated by four reviewers using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation Ⅱ (AGREE Ⅱ) instrument. Along with the item and domain scores, the guideline was also allocated an overall quality score, which ranged from 1 (lowest possible quality) to 7 (highest possible quality). Moreover, an overall recommendation for use was also assigned (\"recommended\", \"recommended with modifications\" or \"not recommended\"). A total of 16 CPGs were included, of which 14 were from Asia and the remaining two from Europe. These two CPGs were updated in the third version. Six CPGs were recommended for use because their primary domains scored in the medium or high category. Furthermore, five CPGs were recommended with modifications as the stakeholder involvement, applicability, and editorial independence domains were evaluated as low categories. In all domains, the lowest average score was for rigour of development (33%), followed by application (36%), and stakeholder involvement (51%). The highest average score was for scope and purpose (79%), followed by clarity of presentation (75%). None of the CPGs considered the patient's viewpoint, and six of 16 CPGs did not use any grading system to translate the evidence into recommendations. Additionally, only three of 16 CPGs shared search strategy, and eight of 16 CPGs did not declare a funding source. According to the AGREE II evaluation, more than one in four CPGs for DKD had poor methodological quality. Enhanced efforts are needed to advance the rigour of development, application, and editorial independence of DKD guideline panels for most guidelines. Stakeholders, CPG developers, and CPG users should consider methodological quality while choosing CPGs, and interpret and implement their issued suggestions.\n",
            "ID: 38767642, Title: Distribution of Traditional Chinese Medicine syndromes in diabetic kidney disease chronic kidney disease 1-5: a correlation study., Abstract: To analyze the distribution of Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) syndromes in patients with diabetic kidney disease (DKD) and its related factors. We enrolled 435 patients with DKD, who were not undergoing dialysis, admitted to the Department of Nephrology, First Medical Center, Chinese PLA General Hospital from April 2020 to August 2021. Analysis of their TCM syndromes and related factors was carried out. The 435 patients included 109, 117, 86, and 123 chronic kidney disease (CKD) 1-2, CKD3, CKD4, and CKD5 cases, respectively. With the progression of CKD1-5, the proportion of <i>Yin</i> deficiency and dry heat syndrome, and that of <i>Qi</i> and <i>Yin</i> deficiency syndrome showed a downward trend, whereas the proportion of spleen-kidney <i>Yang</i> deficiency, blood deficiency, blood stasis, water stagnation, and phlegm turbidity syndromes showed an upward trend; the differences were statistically significant (<i>P</i> < 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that <i>Yin</i> deficiency and dry heat syndrome was positively correlated with hemoglobin [odds ratio (<i>OR</i>) = 1.022, <i>P</i> = 0.005], albumin (<i>OR</i> = 1.058, <i>P =</i> 0.006), and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (<i>OR</i> = 1.020, <i>P <</i> 0.001) but negatively correlated with male sex (<i>OR</i> = 0.277, <i>P =</i> 0.004). <i>Qi</i> and <i>Yin</i> deficiency syndrome was positively correlated with albumin (<i>OR</i> = 1.056, <i>P</i> < 0.001) and eGFR (<i>OR</i> = 1.008, <i>P</i> = 0.022) but negatively correlated with age (<i>OR</i> = 0.977, <i>P</i> = 0.023). Liver-kidney <i>Yin</i> deficiency syndrome was positively correlated with age (<i>OR</i> = 1.028, <i>P =</i> 0.021) and glycosylated hemoglobin (<i>OR</i> = 1.223, <i>P =</i> 0.007) but negatively correlated with total cholesterol (<i>OR</i> = 0.792, <i>P</i> = 0.006). Spleen-kidney <i>Yang</i> deficiency syndrome was negatively correlated with hemoglobin (<i>OR</i> = 0.977, <i>P</i> < 0.001), albumin (<i>OR</i> = 0.891, <i>P</i> < 0.001), and eGFR (<i>OR</i> = 0.978, <i>P</i> < 0.001) but positively correlated with high density lipoprotein (<i>OR</i> = 3.376, <i>P</i> = 0.001). With CKD1-5 progression, TCM syndromes changed from <i>Yin</i> deficiency and dry heat syndrome to syndrome of deficiency of both <i>Qi</i> and <i>Yin</i>, liver-kidney <i>Yin</i>, and spleen-kidney <i>Yang</i> deficiency syndromes. TCM syndromes were correlated with laboratory test results.\n",
            "ID: 38767350, Title: Changes in the type 2 diabetes gut mycobiome associate with metformin treatment across populations., Abstract: The human gut teems with a diverse ecosystem of microbes, yet non-bacterial portions of that community are overlooked in studies of metabolic diseases firmly linked to gut bacteria. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) is associated with compositional shifts in the gut bacterial microbiome and the mycobiome, the fungal portion of the microbiome. However, whether T2D and/or metformin treatment underpins fungal community changes is unresolved. To differentiate these effects, we curated a gut mycobiome cohort spanning 1,000 human samples across five countries and validated our findings in a murine experimental model. We use Bayesian multinomial logistic normal models to show that T2D and metformin both associate with shifts in the relative abundance of distinct gut fungi. T2D is associated with shifts in the Saccharomycetes and Sordariomycetes fungal classes, while the genera <i>Fusarium</i> and <i>Tetrapisipora</i> most consistently associate with metformin treatment. We confirmed the impact of metformin on individual gut fungi by administering metformin to healthy mice. Thus, metformin and T2D account for subtle, but significant and distinct variation in the gut mycobiome across human populations. This work highlights for the first time that metformin can confound associations of gut fungi with T2D and warrants the need to consider pharmaceutical interventions in investigations of linkages between metabolic diseases and gut microbial inhabitants. This is the largest to-date multi-country cohort characterizing the human gut mycobiome, and the first to investigate potential perturbations in gut fungi from oral pharmaceutical treatment. We demonstrate the reproducible effects of metformin treatment on the human and murine gut mycobiome and highlight a need to consider metformin as a confounding factor in investigations between type 2 diabetes mellitus and the gut microbial ecosystem.\n",
            "ID: 38767331, Title: Decoding the complexity of delayed wound healing following <i>Enterococcus faecalis</i> infection., Abstract: Wound infections are highly prevalent and can lead to delayed or failed healing, causing significant morbidity and adverse economic impacts. These infections occur in various contexts, including diabetic foot ulcers, burns, and surgical sites. <i>Enterococcus faecalis</i> is often found in persistent non-healing wounds, but its contribution to chronic wounds remains understudied. To address this, we employed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on infected wounds in comparison to uninfected wounds in a mouse model. Examining over 23,000 cells, we created a comprehensive single-cell atlas that captures the cellular and transcriptomic landscape of these wounds. Our analysis revealed unique transcriptional and metabolic alterations in infected wounds, elucidating the distinct molecular changes associated with bacterial infection compared to the normal wound healing process. We identified dysregulated keratinocyte and fibroblast transcriptomes in response to infection, jointly contributing to an anti-inflammatory environment. Notably, <i>E. faecalis</i> infection prompted a premature, incomplete epithelial-mesenchymal transition in keratinocytes. Additionally, <i>E. faecalis</i> infection modulated M2-like macrophage polarization by inhibiting pro-inflammatory resolution in vitro, in vivo, and in our scRNA-seq atlas. Furthermore, we discovered macrophage crosstalk with neutrophils, which regulates chemokine signaling pathways, while promoting anti-inflammatory interactions with endothelial cells. Overall, our findings offer new insights into the immunosuppressive role of <i>E. faecalis</i> in wound infections.\n",
            "ID: 38767130, Title: Immediate response to intravitreal treatment for macular edema due to diabetes and retinal vein occlusion., Abstract: To objectively assess the immediate response to intravitreal treatment for macular edema and compare it across different agents. This retrospective, comparative study included patients with macular edema due to diabetic retinopathy (DME) or vein occlusion who were treated with intravitreal injections of either steroids (triamcinolone acetonide or dexamethasone sustained release implant) or anti-vascular endothelial growth factor antibodies (VEGF). The central retinal thickness (CRT) and the best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) were measured 1 day after the injection and compared with immediate pre-injection values. There were 79 eyes (57 patients) including 51 eyes with DME, 18 with branch retinal vein occlusion edema (BRVO-ME), and 10 eyes with central retinal vein occlusion edema (CRVO-ME). The intravitreal agents were triamcinolone acetonide (TA)(<i>n</i> = 15), dexamethasone sustained release implant (DEX)(<i>n</i> = 22), ranibizumab (<i>n</i> = 19), and bevacizumab (<i>n</i> = 23). Statistically significant improvement in CRT was seen in all injection groups (<i>p</i> < 0.05) while improvement in mean BCVA was significant only in the TA group (<i>p</i> = 0.009). The mean change in CRT was maximum with steroids than with anti-VEGFs; viz. 159.47 µ in TA, 115.45 µ in DEX, 86.10 µ in ranibizumab, and 78.78 µ in bevacizumab group. Least amount of change was noted in the spongy type of macular edema (18.73 µ) while improvement in mean BCVA was statistically significant only in the cystoid group (<i>p</i> = 0.01). Comparatively, steroid agents showed better immediate response to therapy than anti-VEGFs. Maximum reduction in central retinal thickness was seen following triamcinolone acetonide injection. Cystoid edema showed better immediate response than spongy retinal thickening.\n",
            "ID: 38767128, Title: Severe dawn phenomenon predicts long-term risk of all-cause mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes., Abstract: The dawn phenomenon (DP) is an abnormal early morning blood glucose rise without nocturnal hypoglycaemia, which can be more easily and precisely assessed with continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). This prospective study aimed to explore the association between DP and the risk of all-cause mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes. A total of 5542 adult inpatients with type 2 diabetes in a single centre were analysed. The magnitude of DP (ΔG) was defined as the increment in the CGM-determined glucose value from nocturnal nadir (after 24:00) to prebreakfast. Participants were stratified into four groups by ΔG: ≤1.11, 1.12-3.33, 3.34-5.55, and >5.55 mmol/L. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to evaluate the impact of DP on all-cause mortality risk. During a median follow-up of 9.4 years, 1083 deaths were identified. The restricted cubic spline revealed a nonlinear (p for nonlinearity = 0.002) relationship between ΔG and the risk of all-cause mortality. A multivariate-adjusted Cox regression model including glycated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) showed that ΔG > 5.55 mmol/L was associated with 30% (95% CI, 1.01-1.66) higher risk of all-cause mortality, as compared with ΔG 1.12-3.33 mmol/L. Higher ΔG is significantly related to an increased risk of all-cause mortality in type 2 diabetes, suggesting that severe DP should be given more attention as a part of glucose management to reduce the risk of long-term adverse outcomes.\n",
            "ID: 38767114, Title: Androgens Modulate the Immune Profile in a Mouse Model of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome., Abstract: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is associated with a low-grade inflammation, but it is unknown how hyperandrogenism, the hallmark of PCOS, affects the immune system. Using a PCOS-like mouse model, it is demonstrated that hyperandrogenism affects immune cell populations in reproductive, metabolic, and immunological tissues differently in a site-specific manner. Co-treatment with an androgen receptor antagonist prevents most of these alterations, demonstrating that these effects are mediated through androgen receptor activation. Dihydrotestosterone (DHT)-exposed mice displayed a drastically reduced eosinophil population in the uterus and visceral adipose tissue (VAT). A higher frequency of natural killer (NK) cells and elevated levels of IFN-γ and TNF-α are seen in uteri of androgen-exposed mice, while NK cells in VAT and spleen displayed a higher expression level of CD69, a marker of activation or tissue residency. Distinct alterations of macrophages in the uterus, ovaries, and VAT are also found in DHT-exposed mice and can potentially be linked to PCOS-like traits of the model. Indeed, androgen-exposed mice are insulin-resistant, albeit unaltered fat mass. Collectively, it is demonstrated that hyperandrogenism causes tissue-specific alterations of immune cells in reproductive organs and VAT, which can have considerable implications on tissue function and contribute to the reduced fertility and metabolic comorbidities associated with PCOS.\n",

Its effectiveness and tolerability as an addition to metformin, DPP4 inhibitor and insulin treatment in type 2 diabetic patients will be examined in this research. Participants with type 2 diabetes from poor socio-economic backgrounds had HbA1c values ≥8.5% when using Insulin+Metformin+DPP-4 inhibitors. They received 10mg Empagliflozin daily for 12 weeks (n=143). The main outcome was change in HbA1c at 12<sup>th</sup> week from baseline. Secondary outcomes were baseline weight and week 12 FPG. Adjusted mean (SE) HbA1c increases at week 12 were: Mean ± SD 10.38 (6.8-17.0) vs. Mean±SD 9.05±1.77 (5.60-16.0) with empagliflozin 10mg. When added to the regimen, empagliflozin significantly reduced FPG, systolic and diastolic blood pressure. The mean (SE) BMI increases from baseline were 31.28±5.89 (16.0-66.0) and 29.73±5.47 (3.0-46.0) with 10mg empagliflozin. Two individuals experienced urinary tract infections as AEs, but no genital infections. Adding empagliflozin 10mg daily to metformin+DPP4 inhibitor+insulin improved glycemic control, body weight and blood pressure for 12 weeks. The intervention was well-tolerated, highlighting empagliflozin's therapeutic potential.\n",

Diabetes is considered one of the major risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. The current research is designed to evaluate the cardioprotective effects of dapagliflozin in streptozotocin and isoproterenol-induced comorbid rats. The COX-2, TNF-α, NF-КB, NLRP3, PPAR-γ, CKMB, TROP-I, AR, GP and SGLT were docked against dapagliflozin, propranolol and metformin. Dapagliflozin restored adequate blood flow and halted myofibril damage. Moreover, it's evident from this study that dapagliflozin significantly decreased serum concentration of various blood markers, decreased relative growth rate and QT interval prolongation, as compared to the negative control group. However, it improved the ventricular ejection fraction in rats of the treatment group. The GST, GSH and CAT levels were increased, as compared to normal. On the contrary, a decrease in LPO concentrations was observed. Evaluation of the coronal section of heart tissues showed the anti-inflammatory expressions evaluated through H & E staining and immunohistochemical techniques and with ELISA and PCR. In a nutshell, dapagliflozin reverses myocardial necrosis and apoptosis.\n",

The diabetic condition was evaluated using Streptozotocin's oral glucose tolerance test, diabetes-alloxan and diabetes-models. Antiulcer activities were observed in rats where gastric ulcers were either caused by oral administration of ethanol, or pyloric ligation. Standards include ranitidine, glibenclamide and sucralfate. In all models, the blood glucose levels of animals treated with the test extract were found to be significantly lower compared to diabetic care. Similarly, in all models, the ulcer index in the animals treated with the test extract was found to be significantly lower relative to the animals under vehicle supervision. Our findings say T. Spathacea extract has essential anti-diabetic properties, as well as antiulcer properties.\n",

Glimepiride (GLIM), as a drug of choice in the treatment of diabetes mellitus (DM), has the risk of decreasing the functioning of organs such as the kidneys, liver and pancreas. Black rice bran ethanol extract (EEBRB) with antioxidant content has been shown to protect the kidney, liver and pancreas organs. The aim of this study was to establish the effect of EEBRB on lowering fasting blood glucose (FBG) and protecting several organs after GLIM administration in alloxan (ALX)-induced hyperglycemic rats. A total of 20 rats were divided into 4 groups and treated for 21 days treatments using following preparations: normal control (NC), diabetic group (DC), GLIM 1 mg/ kgBW and combination of glimepiride 1mg/kgBW and EEBRB 50 mg/KgBW (GLBR). The results showed that the GLBR was able to lower blood glucose levels back to normal (<126 mg/dL) and protect kidney, liver and pancreas cells by increasing the amount in normal cells.\n",

Quantification, employing the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode, focused on precursor-to-product ion transitions at m/z 447.1→271.1 for baicalin m/z and 421.0→301.0 for mangiferin. Calibration curves demonstrated linearity in the 1.00~100ng/mL range, with a lower quantification limit for rat plasma set at 1.00ng/mL. Inter- and intra-day accuracies spanned -9.1% to 8.5% and mangiferin mean recovery varied from 82.3% to 86.7%. The adeptly utilized UPLC-MS/MS approach facilitated the exploration of mangiferin pharmacokinetics in diabetic rats.\n",
            "ID: 38767063, Title: Hypoparathyroidism update., Abstract: Since the release of the 2022 Second International Workshop Evaluation and Management of Hypoparathyroidism Summary Statement and Guidelines, updates and advances are now available in the cause, complications, and treatment of adult chronic hypoparathyroidism (hypoPTH). This review aims to highlight these new findings and implications to patient care. Postsurgical hypoparathyroidism remains the most common cause, immune-related hypoparathyroidism from checkpoint inhibitors is an emerging autoimmune cause. In a large retrospective cohort study of thyroidectomies, incident fracture was lower, particularly in the vertebra, in the hypoPTH cohort, compared with postthyroidectomy control group. Hypercalciuria increases risk for renal calculi in hypoPTH independent of disease duration and treatment dose. Quality of life is impaired in hypoPTH patients on conventional therapy, improvement was noted post-PTH replacement. TranCon PTH phase 3 RCT reported eucalcemia with reduced renal calcium excretion, normalization of bone turn-over markers, stable BMD and improved quality of life. HypoPTH is a chronic disease associated with significant morbidity and poor Quality of Life. Awareness of treatment targets and follow-up investigations can alleviate patient anxiety regarding over-treatment and under-treatment. Progress in long-acting PTH replacement strategies might provide accessible, feasible alternatives to conventional therapy in brittle hypoPTH patients.\n",

The new \"ABC\" mnemonic offers clinicians a streamlined framework for applying Class One Recommendations (COR1) and integrating recent updates into CCD management. A critical analysis of the 2023 CCD guidelines was conducted, with this review highlighting key elements. The review outlines crucial changes, including novel recommendations supported by current clinical evidence. The focus is on these developments, clarifying their importance for day-to-day clinical practice. The review encourages a synergistic approach between primary healthcare providers and cardiologists to develop comprehensive strategies for lifestyle modification and medication therapy in CCD care. Furthermore, it suggests that utilizing comprehensive risk assessment tools can refine medical decision-making, ultimately enhancing patient care and clinical outcomes.\n",
            "ID: 38766907, Title: Pembrolizumab-induced type 1 diabetes., Abstract: Immunotherapy has a crucial role in the current treatment of multiple malignancies. Albeit described as rare, new onset autoimmune diabetes is a potentially life-threatening complication of programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) inhibitors, such as pembrolizumab, and its predisposing factors and pathological mechanism are yet to be clarified. We present a case of a 72-year-old man with a high-grade bladder carcinoma undergoing pembrolizumab treatment. He had no personal or family history of diabetes mellitus but was diagnosed with primary hypothyroidism four months after starting pembrolizumab. Two years after starting pembrolizumab, he presented in the emergency department due to abdominal pain, anorexia, polydipsia, polyuria and vomiting over the preceding five days and he met criteria for severe diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Three days prior to his admission, he had received prednisolone therapy for suspected hypersensitivity related to a contrast-enhanced imaging that he performed. Prompt treatment for DKA was started, with transition to insulin basal-bolus therapy after DKA resolution, with progressive glycaemic stabilization. Further investigation revealed low C-peptide levels (0.07 ng/dL, with a fasting blood glucose of 288 mg/dL), HbA1c 9.2% and positive anti-IA2 antibodies, which allowed the diagnosis of new-onset autoimmune diabetes. Pembrolizumab was transiently suspended, and the patient resumed treatment after glycaemic profile optimization under multiple daily insulin administrations two months later. This case highlights the importance of clinical suspicion and glycaemic monitoring as an integral part of treatment protocols in patients on pembrolizumab and other immune checkpoint inhibitors. Additional research and investigation into the underlying mechanisms of this condition are necessary to identify potential screening tests for individuals at higher risk of developing DM and to guide the implementation of management and preventive strategies for ketoacidosis complication.\n",

The present review aims to narrate the clinical guidelines and therapeutic interventions for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) patients. Furthermore, the present work summarizes the ongoing phase 1/2/3 and clinical trials against T2DM. A meticulous and comprehensive literature review was performed using various databases, such as PubMed, MEDLINE, Clinical trials database (https://clinicaltrials.gov/), and Google Scholar, to include various clinical trials and therapeutic interventions against T2DM. Based on our findings, we concluded that most T2DM-associated clinical trials are interventional. Anti-diabetic therapeutics, including insulin, metformin, Dipeptidyl Peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor Agonists (GLP-1RAs), and Sodium- Glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors are frontline therapeutics being clinically investigated. Currently, the therapeutics in phase IV clinical trials are mostly SGLT-2 inhibitors, implicating their critical contribution to the clinical management of T2DM. Despite the success of T2DM treatments, a surge in innovative treatment options to reduce diabetic consequences and improve glycemic control is currently ongoing. More emphasis needs to be on exploring novel targeted drug candidates that can offer more sustained glycemic control.\n",

However, challenges remain, such as limited infiltration into solid tumors, inadequate persistence, systemic toxicities, and manufacturing insufficiencies. The use of alternative cell sources for CAR-based therapies, such as natural killer cells (NK), macrophages (MΦ), invariant Natural Killer T (iNKT) cells, γδT cells, neutrophils, and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC), has emerged as a promising avenue. By harnessing these cells' inherent cytotoxic mechanisms and incorporating CAR technology, common CAR-T cell-related limitations can be effectively mitigated. We herein present an overview of the tumoricidal mechanisms, CAR designs, and manufacturing processes of CAR-NK cells, CAR-MΦ, CAR-iNKT cells, CAR-γδT cells, CAR-neutrophils, and iPSC-derived CAR-cells, outlining the advantages, limitations, and potential solutions of these therapeutic strategies.\n",
            "ID: 38766579, Title: The effect of Tecar therapy on neurological disorders and nerve conduction velocity of lower limbs in peripheral neuropathy of type 2 diabetic patients: A six-week follow-up study., Abstract: This study aimed to investigate the effect of Tecar therapy on neuropathy symptoms and tibial nerve conduction velocity in individuals with diabetes. The single-blind, randomized, sham-controlled clinical trial was conducted between January 2019 and October 2019. Twenty-four type 2 diabetics (8 males, 16 females; mean age: 60.4±8.9 years; range, 40 to 78 years) with peripheral neuropathy were randomly allocated to control (n=12) and study (n=12) groups. The study group received the capacitive Tecar therapy with 10 to 30% intensity and infrared radiation in 10 sessions. The controls received the same protocol with zero intensity. The neuropathy symptoms and nerve conduction velocity were evaluated at baseline, after 10 sessions, and six weeks after the end of sessions. There were no significant differences in variables (p>0.05). In this way, the homogeneity of the data variables was confirmed. Moreover, the results of two-way mixed analysis of variance showed that improvement of neuropathy symptoms in the study group was significantly more than controls in all stages (p<0.001). After 10 sessions, the results of post hoc analysis showed that the neuropathy symptoms and tibial nerve conduction velocity were significantly improved in both groups (p<0.05). However, there was no change in these outcomes after six weeks in the control group (p>0.05). Tecar therapy could improve neuropathy symptoms and tibial nerve conduction velocity in diabetic individuals with peripheral neuropathy. Therefore, the use of this method to control the symptoms of diabetic patients can be recommended.\n",
            "ID: 38766481, Title: Balance performance, falls-efficacy and social participation in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with and without vestibular dysfunction., Abstract: The performance of balance is an important factor to perform activities. The complications of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), especially vestibular dysfunction (VD), could decrease balance performance and falls-efficacy (FE) which consequently impacts social participation and quality of life (QoL). This study aimed to compare balance performance, FE, social participation and QoL between individuals with T2DM with and without VD. The participants comprised 161 T2DM with VD and 161 without VD. Three clinical tests used for confirming VD included the Head Impulse Test (HIT), the Dix Hallpike Test (DHT) and the Supine Roll Test (SRT). The scores of static and dynamic balances, FE, social participation and QoL were compared between groups. The balance performance, FE, social participation and QoL were lower in the group with VD. The number of patients who had severe social restriction was higher in T2DM with VD than without VD (58.4% <i>vs</i> 48.4%). Moreover, all domains of QoL (physical, psychological, social relationships and environmental) were lower in T2DM with VD than without VD. The presence of VD in T2DM patients was associated with decreased physical balance performances and increased social and QoL disengagement. Comprehensive management related to balance and FE, as well as the monitoring to support social participation and QoL, should be emphasized in patients with T2DM with VD.\n",
            "ID: 38766443, Title: Insulin therapy in type 2 diabetes: Insights into clinical efficacy, patient-reported outcomes, and adherence challenges., Abstract: Insulin therapy plays a crucial role in the management of type 2 diabetes as the disease progresses. Over the past century, insulin formulations have undergone significant modifications and bioengineering, resulting in a diverse range of available insulin products. These products show distinct pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles. Consequently, various insulin regimens have em-erged for the management of type 2 diabetes, including premixed formulations and combinations of basal and bolus insulins. The utilization of different insulin regimens yields disparate clinical outcomes, adverse events, and, notably, patient-reported outcomes (PROs). PROs provide valuable insights from the patient's perspective, serving as a valuable mine of information for enhancing healthcare and informing clinical decisions. Adherence to insulin therapy, a critical patient-reported outcome, significantly affects clinical outcomes and is influenced by multiple factors. This review provides insights into the clinical effectiveness of various insulin preparations, PROs, and factors impacting insulin therapy adherence, with the aim of enhancing healthcare practices and informing clinical decisions for individuals with type 2 diabetes.\n",
            "ID: 38766441, Title: Efficacy of Huangma Ding or autologous platelet-rich gel for the diabetic lower extremity arterial disease patients with foot ulcers., Abstract: Diabetes foot is one of the most serious complications of diabetes and an important cause of death and disability, traditional treatment has poor efficacy and there is an urgent need to develop a practical treatment method. To investigate whether Huangma Ding or autologous platelet-rich gel (APG) treatment would benefit diabetic lower extremity arterial disease (LEAD) patients with foot ulcers. A total of 155 diabetic LEAD patients with foot ulcers were enrolled and divided into three groups: Group A (62 patients; basal treatment), Group B (38 patients; basal treatment and APG), and Group C (55 patients; basal treatment and Huangma Ding). All patients underwent routine follow-up visits for six months. After follow-up, we calculated the changes in all variables from baseline and determined the differences between groups and the relationships between parameters. The infection status of the three groups before treatment was the same. Procalcitonin (PCT) improved after APG and Huangma Ding treatment more than after traditional treatment and was significantly greater in Group C than in Group B. Logistic regression analysis revealed that PCT was positively correlated with total amputation, primary amputation, and minor amputation rates. The ankle-brachial pressure and the transcutaneous oxygen pressure in Groups B and C were greater than those in Group A. The major amputation rate, minor amputation rate, and total amputation times in Groups B and C were lower than those in Group A. Our research indicated that diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) lead to major amputation, minor amputation, and total amputation through local infection and poor microcirculation and macrocirculation. Huangma Ding and APG were effective attreating DFUs. The clinical efficacy of Huangma Ding was better than that of autologous platelet gel, which may be related to the better control of local infection by Huangma Ding. This finding suggested that in patients with DFUs combined with coinfection, controlling infection is as important as improving circulation.\n",
            "ID: 38766440, Title: Impact of tibial transverse transport in tissue regeneration and wound healing with perspective on diabetic foot ulcers., Abstract: In this editorial, we comment on an article by Liao <i>et al</i> published in the current issue of the <i>World Journal of Diabetes</i>. We focus on the clinical significance of tibial transverse transport (TTT) as an effective treatment for patients with diabetic foot ulcers (DFU). TTT has been associated with tissue regeneration, improved blood circulation, reduced amputation rates, and increased expression of early angiogenic factors. Mechanistically, TTT can influence macrophage polarization and growth factor upregulation. Despite this potential, the limitations and conflicting results of existing studies justify the need for further research into its optimal application and development. These clinical implications highlight the efficacy of TTT in recalcitrant DFU and provide lasting stimuli for tissue re-generation, and blood vessel and bone marrow improvement. Immunomodulation <i>via</i> systemic responses contributes to its therapeutic potential. Future studies should investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms to enhance our understanding and the efficacy of TTT. This manuscript emphasizes the potential of TTT in limb preservation and diabetic wound healing and suggests avenues for preventive measures against limb amputation in diabetes and peripheral artery disease. Here, we highlight the clinical significance of the TTT and its importance in healing DFU to promote the use of this technique in tissue regeneration.\n",
            "ID: 38766439, Title: Synaptotagmins family affect glucose transport in retinal pigment epithelial cells through their ubiquitination-mediated degradation and glucose transporter-1 regulation., Abstract: Synaptotagmins (SYTs) are a family of 17 membrane transporters that function as calcium ion sensors during the release of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent neurotransmitters and hormones. However, few studies have reported whether members of the SYT family play a role in glucose uptake in diabetic retinopathy (DR) through Ca<sup>2+</sup>/glucose transporter-1 (GLUT1) and the possible regulatory mechanism of SYTs. To elucidate the role of the SYT family in the regulation of glucose transport in retinal pigment epithelial cells and explore its potential as a therapeutic target for the clinical management of DR. DR was induced by streptozotocin in C57BL/6J mice and by high glucose medium in human retinal pigment epithelial cells (ARPE-19). Bioinformatics analysis, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, Western blot, flow cytometry, ELISA, HE staining, and TUNEL staining were used for analysis. Six differentially expressed proteins (SYT2, SYT3, SYT4, SYT7, SYT11, and SYT13) were found between the DR and control groups, and SYT4 was highly expressed. Hyperglycemia induces SYT4 overexpression, manipulates Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx to induce GLUT1 fusion with the plasma membrane, promotes abnormal expression of the glucose transporter GLUT1 and excessive glucose uptake, induces ARPE-19 cell apoptosis, and promotes DR progression. Parkin deficiency inhibits the proteasomal degradation of SYT4 in DR, resulting in SYT4 accumulation and enhanced GLUT1 fusion with the plasma membrane, and these effects were blocked by oe-Parkin treatment. Moreover, dysregulation of the myelin transcription factor 1 (Myt1)-induced transcription of SYT4 in DR further activated the SYT4-mediated stimulus-secretion coupling process, and this process was inhibited in the oe-MYT1-treated group. Our study reveals the key role of SYT4 in regulating glucose transport in retinal pigment epithelial cells during the pathogenesis of DR and the underlying mechanism and suggests potential therapeutic targets for clinical DR.\n",

Luo's study demonstrated the efficacy of customized nutritional therapies in controlling GDM. Tailored strategies led to significant body weight loss, improved glucolipid metabolism, and fewer prenatal and newborn problems. This holistic approach, which emphasizes the notion of 'chrononutrition', takes into account optimal meal timing that is in sync with circadian rhythms, as well as enhanced sleep hygiene.

            "ID: 38766434, Title: Estrogen restores disordered lipid metabolism in visceral fat of prediabetic mice., Abstract: Visceral obesity is increasingly prevalent among adolescents and young adults and is commonly recognized as a risk factor for type 2 diabetes. Estrogen [17β-estradiol (E2)] is known to offer protection against obesity <i>via</i> diverse me-chanisms, while its specific effects on visceral adipose tissue (VAT) remain to be fully elucidated. To investigate the impact of E2 on the gene expression profile within VAT of a mouse model of prediabetes. Metabolic parameters were collected, encompassing body weight, weights of visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissues (VAT and SAT), random blood glucose levels, glucose tolerance, insulin tolerance, and overall body composition. The gene expression profiles of VAT were quantified utilizing the Whole Mouse Genome Oligo Microarray and subsequently analyzed through Agilent Feature Extraction software. Functional and pathway analyses were conducted employing Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analyses, respectively. Feeding a high-fat diet (HFD) moderately increased the weights of both VAT and SAT, but this increase was mitigated by the protective effect of endogenous E2. Conversely, ovariectomy (OVX) led to a significant increase in VAT weight and the VAT/SAT weight ratio, and this increase was also reversed with E2 treatment. Notably, OVX diminished the expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism compared to HFD feeding alone, signaling a widespread reduction in lipid metabolic activity, which was completely counteracted by E2 administration. This study provides a comprehensive insight into E2's local and direct protective effects against visceral adiposity in VAT at the gene level. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that the HFD-induced over-nutritional challenge disrupted the gene expression profile of visceral fat, leading to a universally decreased lipid metabolic status in E2 deficient mice. E2 treatment effectively reversed this condition, shedding light on the mechanistic role and therapeutic potential of E2 in combating visceral obesity.\n",
            "ID: 38766433, Title: Glucokinase regulatory protein rs780094 polymorphism is associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and nephropathy., Abstract: In this editorial, we comment on the article by Liu <i>et al</i> published in the recent issue of the <i>World Journal of Diabetes</i> (Relationship between GCKR gene rs780094 polymorphism and type 2 diabetes with albuminuria). Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic disorder characterized by dysregulated glucose homeostasis. The persistent elevated blood glucose level in T2DM significantly increases the risk of developing severe complications, including cardiovascular disease, re-tinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy. T2DM arises from a complex interplay between genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors. Global genomic studies have identified numerous genetic variations associated with an increased risk of T2DM. Specifically, variations within the glucokinase regulatory protein (GCKR) gene have been linked to heightened susceptibility to T2DM and its associated complications. The clinical trial by Liu <i>et al</i> further elucidates the role of the GCKR rs780094 polymorphism in T2DM and nephropathy development. Their findings demonstrate that individuals carrying the CT or TT genotype at the GCKR rs780094 locus are at a higher risk of developing T2DM with albuminuria compared to those with the CC genotype. These findings highlight the importance of genetic testing and risk assessment in T2DM to develop effective preventive strategies and personalized treatment plans.\n",

To evaluate the risk of infection in patients with T2DM treated with dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors. Electronic databases were searched. The selection criteria included randomized controlled trials focused on cardiovascular outcomes. In these studies, the effects of DPP-4 inhibitors were directly compared to those of either other active anti-diabetic treatments or placebo. Six trials involving 53616 patients were deemed eligible. We calculated aggregate relative risks employing both random-effects and fixed-effects approaches, contingent upon the context. The application of DPP-4 inhibitors showed no significant link to the overall infection risk [0.98 (0.95, 1.02)] or the risk of serious infections [0.96 (0.85, 1.08)], additionally, no significant associations were found with opportunistic infections [0.69 (0.46, 1.04)], site-specific infections [respiratory infection 0.99 (0.96, 1.03), urinary tract infections 1.02 (0.95, 1.10), abdominal and gastrointestinal infections 1.02 (0.83, 1.25), skin structure and soft tissue infections 0.81 (0.60, 1.09), bone infections 0.96 (0.68, 1.36), and bloodstream infections 0.97 (0.80, 1.18)]. This meta-analysis of data from cardiovascular outcome trials revealed no heightened infection risk in patients undergoing DPP-4 inhibitor therapy compared to control cohorts.\n",

Its etiology is closely tied to imbalanced dietary practices and sedentary lifestyles. Conversely, increasing die-tary fiber (DF) intake has consistently demonstrated health benefits in numerous studies, including improvements in glycemic control and weight management. To investigate the efficacy of DF interventions in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). A systematic literature review was conducted to explore the association between DF intake and the management of T2DM. Following the inclusion and exclusion criteria, a total of 26 studies were included in this review. The main strategies implied to increased DF intake were: High DF diet plus acarbose (2 studies); DF supplements (14 studies); and high DF diets (10 studies). Overall, most studies indicated that increased DF intake resulted in im-provements in glycemic control and weight management in T2DM patients. DF represents a valuable strategy in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, improving health outcomes. DF intake offers the potential to improve quality of life and reduce complications and mortality associated with diabetes. Likewise, through supplements or enriched foods, DF contributes significantly to the control of several markers such as HbA1c, blood glucose, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein, and body weight.\n",

However, the mechanism through which <i>Radix Salviae</i> treats DPN remains unclear. Therefore, we aimed to explore the mechanism of action of <i>Radix Salviae</i> against DPN using network pharmacology. The active ingredients and target genes of <i>Radix Salviae</i> were screened using the TCM pharmacology database and analysis platform. The genes associated with DPN were obtained from the Gene Cards and OMIM databases, a drug-com-position-target-disease network was constructed, and a protein-protein inter-action network was subsequently constructed to screen the main targets. Gene Ontology (GO) functional annotation and pathway enrichment analysis were performed <i>via</i> the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) using Bioconductor. A total of 56 effective components, 108 targets and 4581 DPN-related target genes of <i>Radix Salviae</i> were screened. Intervention with <i>Radix Salviae</i> for DPN mainly involved 81 target genes. The top 30 major targets were selected for enrichment analysis of GO and KEGG pathways. These results suggested that <i>Radix Salviae</i> could treat DPN by regulating the AGE-RAGE signaling pathway and the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. Therefore, Danshen may affect DPN by regulating inflammation and apoptosis.\n",

            "ID: 38766427, Title: Tuberculosis-diabetes comorbidities: Mechanistic insights for clinical considerations and treatment challenges., Abstract: Tuberculosis (TB) remains a leading cause of death among infectious diseases, particularly in poor countries. Viral infections, multidrug-resistant and ex-tensively drug-resistant TB strains, as well as the coexistence of chronic illnesses such as diabetes mellitus (DM) greatly aggravate TB morbidity and mortality. DM [particularly type 2 DM (T2DM)] and TB have converged making their control even more challenging. Two contemporary global epidemics, TB-DM behaves like a syndemic, a synergistic confluence of two highly prevalent diseases. T2DM is a risk factor for developing more severe forms of multi-drug resistant-TB and TB recurrence after preventive treatment. Since a bidirectional relationship exists between TB and DM, it is necessary to concurrently treat both, and promote recommendations for the joint management of both diseases. There are also some drug-drug interactions resulting in adverse treatment outcomes in TB-DM patients including treatment failure, and reinfection. In addition, autophagy may play a role in these comorbidities. Therefore, the TB-DM comorbidities present several health challenges, requiring a focus on multidisciplinary collaboration and integrated strategies, to effectively deal with this double burden. To effectively manage the comorbidity, further screening in affected countries, more suitable drugs, and better treatment strategies are required.\n",
            "ID: 38766425, Title: Cardioprotective effects of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists in heart failure: Myth or truth?, Abstract: Therapy with glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP1) receptor agonists has raised great interest for its beneficial cardiovascular effects in preventing atherosclerosis and heart failure-related outcomes. However, while evidence about atherosclerosis consistently suggests a cardioprotective potential with class effect, controversies remain on its impact on heart failure. GLP1 receptor agonists appear to prevent hospitalization for new-onset heart failure and reduce symptoms in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (as demonstrated by the recent STEP-HFpEF Trial). Still, GLP1 agonism has resulted in neutral or even harmful effects in patients with established heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (the LIVE trial). GLP1 receptor agonists benefit the cardiovascular system indirectly through their marked metabolic effects (improved weight management, glycemic control, blood pressure, systemic and tissue inflammation), while direct effects on the heart have been questioned. Nonetheless, weight loss alone achieved through GLP1 receptor agonists has failed in improving left ventricular functions. Tirzepatide is a dual agonist of GLP1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide, representing an innovative treatment option in diabetes with a major impact on weight loss and promising cardiovascular benefits. Whether this class of therapies is going to change the history of heart failure is an ongoing debate.\n",
            "ID: 38766423, Title: Challenges and pitfalls of youth-onset type 2 diabetes., Abstract: The incidence and prevalence of youth-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are increasing. The rise in frequency and severity of childhood obesity, inclination to sedentary lifestyle, and epigenetic risks related to prenatal hyperglycemia exposure are important drivers of the youth-onset T2DM epidemic and might as well be responsible for the early onset of diabetes complications. Indeed, youth-onset T2DM has a more extreme metabolic phenotype than adult-onset T2DM, with greater insulin resistance and more rapid deterioration of beta cell function. Therefore, intermediate complications such as microalbuminuria develop in late childhood or early adulthood, while end-stage complications develop in mid-life. Due to the lack of efficacy and safety data, several drugs available for the treatment of adults with T2DM have not been approved in youth, reducing the pharmacological treatment options. In this mini review, we will try to address the present challenges and pitfalls related to youth-onset T2DM and summarize the available interventions to mitigate the risk of microvascular and macrovascular complications.\n",
            "ID: 38766422, Title: Drawing lines in the sand: The growing threat of obesity in type 1 diabetes., Abstract: In this editorial, we comment on the article by Zeng <i>et al</i> published in the recent issue of the <i>World Journal of Diabetes</i> in 2024. We focus on the epidemiological, pathophysiological, and clinical interplay between obesity and type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Overweight and obesity represent a growing threat for modern societies and people with T1DM could not be an exception to this rule. Chronic exogenous insulin administration, genetic and epigenetic factors, and psy-chosocial and behavioral parameters, along with the modern way of life that incorporates unhealthy eating patterns and physical inactivity, set the stage for the increasing obesity rates in T1DM. As our knowledge of the underlying mechanisms that lead to the development of obesity and hyperglycemia expands, it becomes clear that there are overlap zones in the pathophysiology of the two main types of diabetes. Stereotypes regarding strict dividing lines between \"autoimmune\" and \"metabolic\" phenotypes increase the risk of trapping physicians into ineffective therapeutic approaches, instead of individualized diabetes care. In this context, the use of adjuncts to insulin therapy that have the potential to alleviate cardiorenal risk and decrease body weight can reduce the burden of obesity in patients with T1DM.\n",
            "ID: 38766351, Title: Prognostic factors and clinical features of rhino-orbital-mucormycosis cases: an update for patient and visual survivals., Abstract: To determine the frequency of patients' vision survival and prognostic factors and evaluate clinical features in rhino-orbital mucormycosis. Forty-three eyes of 43 patients followed up with orbital mucormycosis infections were included in the study. Demographic characteristics of the patients, symptoms at admission, ophthalmologic and non-ophthalmologic examination findings, clinical findings during follow-up, medical and surgical procedures, and complications were recorded. Patient survival was determined by assessing the incidence of mortality, and vision survival was defined as achieving a final visual acuity of at least light perception. Twenty-seven (62.8%) patients were male, and 16 (37.2%) were female. When the underlying disease status of the patients was examined, it was observed that all patients had an underlying disease and diabetes constituted the majority (65.2%). Periorbital swelling (69.8%) and ophthalmoplegia (53.5%) were the most common symptoms and findings at the admission of patients with mucormycosis infection. The disease resulted in death in 22 (51.2%) patients. The presence of fever and shorter duration of antifungal therapy were associated with lower patient survival. Exenteration surgery was not found to be associated with the survival of the patients. Frozen eye, loss of pupillary light reflex, and development of central retinal artery occlusion were associated with lower vision survival. This study presents one of the most extensive patient series in the literature on rhino-orbital mucormycosis. Knowing the patients' symptoms at the time of admission and the clinical findings during the infection process will increase awareness about the disease.\n",
            "ID: 38766320, Title: Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter-2 Inhibitors and Cardiovascular Protection Among Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: A Systematic Review., Abstract: <b>Background:</b> Accumulating evidence has demonstrated the positive effects of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors in managing patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). SGLT2 inhibitors protect patients with T2DM from cardiovascular complications and are generally safe. <b>Aim:</b> The aim of this study is to assess the cardiovascular effects of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with T2DM. <b>Methods:</b> A systematic review was conducted using published English literature in PubMed and Google Scholar databases. <b>Results:</b> Most of the studies showed significant positive cardiovascular effects of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with and without established cardiovascular disease (CVD). Empagliflozin reduced the risk of cardiovascular death, hospitalization for heart failure (HHF), cardiovascular death or heart failure, and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) such as nonfatal stroke, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular death regardless of the number of cardiovascular risk factors. The effects of empagliflozin on cardiovascular events and mortality in patients with coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) were assessed. Further, the efficacy of empagliflozin in three different phenotypic groups, namely, younger patients with shorter duration of T2DM and highest glomerular filtration rate, women without coronary artery disease, and older adults with advanced coronary artery disease plus several comorbidities, was also assessed. The effects of canagliflozin were evaluated in patients with and without a history of CVD and with different body weights, and in those with and without prior heart failure. Treatment with canagliflozin based on multivariable-predicted cardiovascular risk factors prevented heart failure events more than treatment based on glycated hemoglobin and albuminuria alone. The efficacy of dapagliflozin was evaluated in patients with or at risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), heart failure status, and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), as well as the elderly population. A reduction in HHF or cardiovascular death and insignificant reduction in MACE were noted. Furthermore, significant reduction in the risk of cardiovascular death and all-cause mortality in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) was also observed. Sotagliflozin was studied for its cardiovascular outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease with or without albuminuria and resulted in a reduction in cardiovascular-related deaths and HHF. <b>Conclusion:</b> SGLT2 inhibitors have beneficial cardiovascular effects in patients with T2DM and should be incorporated into their management.\n",
            "ID: 38766319, Title: NET-Related Gene as Potential Diagnostic Biomarkers for Diabetic Tubulointerstitial Injury., Abstract: <b>Background:</b> Tubulointerstitial injury plays a pivotal role in the progression of diabetic kidney disease (DKD), yet the link between neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and diabetic tubulointerstitial injury is still unclear. <b>Methods:</b> We analyzed microarray data (GSE30122) from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with DKD's tubulointerstitial injury. Functional and pathway enrichment analyses were conducted to elucidate the involved biological processes (BP) and pathways. Weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) identified modules associated with DKD. LASSO regression and random forest selected NET-related characteristic genes (NRGs) related to DKD tubulointerstitial injury. <b>Results:</b> Eight hundred ninety-eight DEGs were identified from the GSE30122 dataset. A significant module associated with diabetic tubulointerstitial injury overlapped with 15 NRGs. The hub genes, CASP1 and LYZ, were identified as potential biomarkers. Functional enrichment linked these genes with immune cell trafficking, metabolic alterations, and inflammatory responses. NRGs negatively correlated with glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in the Neph v5 database. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) validated increased NRGs in DKD tubulointerstitial injury. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our findings suggest that the CASP1 and LYZ genes may serve as potential diagnostic biomarkers for diabetic tubulointerstitial injury. Furthermore, NRGs involved in diabetic tubulointerstitial injury could emerge as prospective targets for the diagnosis and treatment of DKD.\n",
            "ID: 38766281, Title: Implication of serum and salivary albumin tests in the recent oral health related epidemiological studies: A narrative review., Abstract: Albumin is the most abundant protein in human serum and a specific amount of albumin also can be found in the saliva. It has several physiological functions such as blood colloidal osmotic pressure, antioxidant activity, binding and transporting of endogenous and exogenous substrates. We conducted an electronic search across several databases such as PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane, Embase and Science Direct using the relevant MeSH terms and keywords like \"albumin\", \"serum albumin\", \"salivary albumin\", \"oral health\" \"dental caries\" and \"epidemiology\". Only the epidemiological studies published between 2010 and 2023 were included. After the application of the inclusion criteria, a total of 51 studied were included in this narrative review. Serum and salivary albumin tests have been used in various aspects of oral health as a diagnostic and prognostic factor. Some of the results point out to a pattern of association while some of them are inconclusive and even contradictory. This narrative review discusses the role, significance and impact of albumin in epidemiological oral health related studies including the categories of periodontal health and disease, dental caries, oral function and hypofunction, nutrition and malnutrition, tooth loss and its treatment, diabetes and cancer. In addition, it offers a short manual for the researchers on when, where and how to use albumin tests in planning their study designs whether investigating an association or measure them as a covariate.\n",
            "ID: 38766166, Title: Pharmacological inhibition of tyrosine protein-kinase 2 reduces islet inflammation and delays type 1 diabetes onset in mice., Abstract: Tyrosine protein-kinase 2 (TYK2), a member of the Janus kinase family, mediates inflammatory signaling through multiple cytokines, including interferon-α (IFNα), interleukin (IL)-12, and IL-23. Missense mutations in TYK2 are associated with protection against type 1 diabetes (T1D), and inhibition of TYK2 shows promise in the management of other autoimmune conditions. Here, we evaluated the effects of specific TYK2 inhibitors (TYK2is) in pre-clinical models of T1D. First, human β cells, cadaveric donor islets, and iPSC-derived islets were treated <i>in vitro</i> with IFNα in combination with a small molecule TYK2i (BMS-986165 or a related molecule BMS-986202). TYK2 inhibition prevented IFNα-induced β cell HLA class I up-regulation, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and chemokine production. In co-culture studies, pre-treatment of β cells with a TYK2i prevented IFNα-induced activation of T cells targeting an epitope of insulin. <i>In vivo</i> administration of BMS-986202 in two mouse models of T1D ( <i>RIP-LCMV-GP</i> mice and NOD mice) reduced systemic and tissue-localized inflammation, prevented β cell death, and delayed T1D onset. Transcriptional phenotyping of pancreatic islets, pancreatic lymph nodes (PLN), and spleen during early disease pathogenesis highlighted a role for TYK2 inhibition in modulating signaling pathways associated with inflammation, translational control, stress signaling, secretory function, immunity, and diabetes. Additionally, TYK2i treatment changed the composition of innate and adaptive immune cell populations in the blood and disease target tissues, resulting in an immune phenotype with a diminished capacity for β cell destruction. Overall, these findings indicate that TYK2i has beneficial effects in both the immune and endocrine compartments in models of T1D, thus supporting a path forward for testing TYK2 inhibitors in human T1D.\n",
            "ID: 38765972, Title: Association between Glucagon-Like Peptide 1 (GLP-1) Receptor Agonists Exposure and Intraocular Pressure Change., Abstract: This study aims to provide data on the effects of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists on intraocular pressure (IOP). Retrospective cohort study. 1247 glaucoma surgery and treatment naïve eyes of 626 patients who were initiated on GLP-1R agonists compared to 1083 glaucoma surgery and treatment naïve eyes of 547 patients who were initiated on other oral antidiabetics. The University of California Health Data Warehouse was queried for patients exposed to GLP-1R agonists or other oral antidiabetics. Index date was defined as the date of first exposure to the medication. Eyes with at least one pre-exposure and one post-exposure tonometry record within 365 days of the index date were included in the analysis. Clinical and laboratory data elements were extracted from the database. Eyes were censored from the analysis upon exposure to glaucoma hypotensive medication or glaucoma surgery. ΔIOP was analyzed using a paired t-test. Regression analysis was conducted using generalized estimating equations (GEE) accounting for inter-eye correlation. Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the robustness of the findings. Primary outcome measure was ΔIOP after exposure to the medication. The median age of all included subjects was 66.2 years [IQR=18.3]; 607 (51.7%) were female, and 667 (56.9%) were Caucasian. Median pre-exposure IOP, HbA1c, and BMI were 15.2 mmHg [IQR=3.8], 7.5 [IQR=2.4], and 29.8 [IQR=9.4], respectively. 776 individuals (66.1%) had diabetes, with the median number of active oral antidiabetics being 1.0 [IQR=1.0], and 441 (37.5%) being insulin users. Several pre-exposure characteristics significantly differed between the GLP-1R agonist and the control group. The mean ΔIOP was -0.4±2.8 mmHg (paired t-test p<0.001) and -0.2±3.3 mmHg (paired t-test p = 0.297) in the GLP-1R agonist and other antidiabetics groups, respectively. Pre-exposure IOP was the only independent predictor of ΔIOP in multivariable GEE. Sensitivity analyses yielded similar results. Although GLP-1R agonists were significantly associated with a decrease in IOP in the paired analysis, they were not associated with ΔIOP in multivariable GEE. Moreover, the difference between the ΔIOP in the two groups was small. Future prospective studies following a standardized dose and delivery method may provide further insights.\n",
            "ID: 38765955, Title: Unraveling genetic causality between metformin and myocardial infarction on the basis of Mendelian randomization., Abstract: In recent years, several studies have explored the effect of metformin on myocardial infarction (MI), but whether metformin has an improvement effect in patients with MI is controversial. This study was aimed to investigate the causal relationship between metformin and MI using Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. The genome-wide significant (<i>P</i><5×10<sup>-8</sup>) single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in patients with metformin and patients with MI were screened from the Open genome-wide association study (GWAS) project as instrumental variables (IVs). The study outcomes mainly included MI, old MI, acute MI, acute transmural MI of inferior wall, and acute transmural MI of anterior wall. The inverse variance weighted (IVW) method was applied to assess the main causal effect, and weighted median, simple mode, weighted mode methods, and MR-Egger regression were auxiliary applied for supplementary proof. The causal relationship between metformin and MI was assessed using odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). A leave-one-out method was used to explore the effect of individual SNPs on the results of IVW analyses, and a funnel plot was used to analyze the potential bias of the study results, thus ensuring the robustness of the results. In total, 16, 84, 39, 26, and 34 SNPs were selected as IVs to assess the genetic association between metformin and outcomes of MI, old MI, acute MI, acute transmural MI of inferior wall, and acute transmural MI of anterior wall, respectively. Treatment with metformin does not affect the risk of acute transmural MI of anterior wall at the genetic level (<i>P</i>>0.05; OR for inverse variance weighted was 1.010). In the cases of MI, old MI, acute MI, and acute transmural MI of inferior wall, metformin may even be a risk factor for patients (<i>P</i><0.05; ORs for inverse variance weighted were 1.078, 1.026, 1.022 and 1.018 respectively). There was no horizontal pleiotropy or heterogeneity among IVs. The results were stable when removing the SNPs one by one. Metformin is not protective against the risk of myocardial infarction in patients and may even be a risk factor for MI, old MI, acute MI, and acute transmural MI of inferior wall.\n",

The prevalence of KPD has not been evaluated in children. We investigated children with DKA at \"T2D\" onset and determined the prevalence and characteristics of pediatric <i>A</i><sup>-</sup><i>β</i><sup>+</sup> KPD within this cohort. We reviewed the records of 716 children with T2D at a large academic hospital and compared clinical characteristics of those with and without DKA at onset. In the latter group, we identified patients with <i>A</i><sup>-</sup><i>β</i><sup>+</sup> KPD using criteria of the Rare and Atypical Diabetes Network (RADIANT) and defined its prevalence and characteristics. Mean age at diagnosis was 13.7 ± 2.4 years: 63% female; 59% Hispanic, 29% African American, 9% non-Hispanic White, and 3% other. Fifty-six (7.8%) presented with DKA at diagnosis and lacked islet autoantibodies. Children presenting with DKA were older and had lower C-peptide and higher glucose concentrations than those without DKA. Twenty-five children with DKA (45%) met RADIANT <i>A</i><sup>-</sup><i>β</i><sup>+</sup> KPD criteria. They were predominantly male (64%), African American or Hispanic (96%), with substantial C-peptide (1.3 ± 0.7 ng/mL) at presentation with DKA and excellent long-term glycemic control (HbA1c 6.6% ± 1.9% at follow-up (median 1.3 years postdiagnosis)). In children with a clinical phenotype of T2D and DKA at diagnosis, approximately half meet criteria for <i>A</i><sup>-</sup><i>β</i><sup>+</sup> KPD.

            "ID: 38765803, Title: The future of diabetic wound healing: unveiling the potential of mesenchymal stem cell and exosomes therapy., Abstract: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a significant public health problem and is one of the most challenging medical conditions worldwide. It is the severe complications that make this disease more intricate. A diabetic wound is one of these complications. Patients with diabetes are at higher risk of developing diabetic foot ulcers (DFU). Due to the ineffectiveness of Conventional treatments, growth in limb amputation, morbidity, and mortality have been recognized, which indicates the need for additional treatment. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can significantly improve wound healing. However, there are some risks related to stem cell therapy. Exosome therapy is a new treatment option for diabetic wounds that has shown promising results. However, an even more advanced form called cell-free therapy using exosomes has emerged. This upgraded version of stem cell therapy offers improved efficacy and eliminates the risk of cancer progression. Exosome therapy promotes wound healing from multiple angles, unlike traditional methods that primarily rely on the body's self-healing ability and only provide wound protection. Therefore, exosome therapy has the potential to replace conventional treatments effectively. However, further research is necessary to distinguish the optimal type of stem cells for therapy, ensure their safety, establish appropriate dosing, and identify the best management trail. The present study focused on the current literature on diabetic wound ulcers, their treatment, and mesenchymal stem cell and exosome therapy potential in DFU.\n",
            "ID: 38765768, Title: Factors Associated with Patient Education in Patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) - A Primary Health Care Register-Based Study., Abstract: Patient education in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is recommended in treatment strategy documents, since it can improve the ability to cope with the disease. Our aim was to identify the extent of and factors associated with patient education in patients with COPD in a primary health care setting. In this nationwide study, we identified 29,692 COPD patients with a registration in the Swedish National Airway Register (SNAR) in 2019. Data on patient education and other clinical variables of interest were collected from SNAR. The database was linked to additional national registers to obtain data about pharmacological treatment, exacerbations and educational level. Patient education had been received by 44% of COPD patients, 72% of whom had received education on pharmacological treatment including inhalation technique. A higher proportion of patients who had received education were offered smoking cessation support, had performed spirometry and answered the COPD Assessment Test (CAT), compared with patients without patient education. In the adjusted analysis, GOLD grade 2 (OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.18-1.42), grade 3 (OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.27-1.57) and grade 4 (OR 1.79, 95% CI 1.48-2.15), as well as GOLD group E (OR 1.17, 95% CI 1.06-1.29), ex-smoking (OR 1.70, 95% CI 1.56-1.84) and current smoking (OR 1.45, 95% CI 1.33-1.58) were positively associated with having received patient education, while cardiovascular disease (OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.87-0.98) and diabetes (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.87-1.00) were negatively associated with receipt of patient education. Fewer than half of the patients had received patient education, and the education had mostly been given to those with more severe COPD, ex- and current smokers and patients with fewer comorbidities. Our study highlights the need to enhance patient education at an earlier stage of the disease.\n",

Although endoscopic methods are mostly used in its treatment, it has high recurrence rates. Therefore, open urethroplasty is recommended after unsuccessful endoscopic treatments. To investigate the risk factors associated with urethral stricture recurrence. The data of male patients who underwent internal urethrotomy for urethral stricture between January 2017 and January 2023 were retrospectively analyzed. Demographic data, comorbidities, preoperative haemogram, and biochemical values obtained from peripheral blood and operative data were recorded. Patients were divided into two groups in terms of recurrence development; recurrence and non-recurrence. Initially recorded data were compared between the two groups. A total of 303 patients were included in the study. The mean age of the patients was 66.6 ± 13.6 years. The mean duration of recurrence development was 9.63 ± 9.84 (min-max: 1-39) months in the recurrence group. Recurrence did not occur in non-recurrence group throughout the follow-up period with an average time of 44.15 ± 24.07 (min-max: 12-84) months. In the comparison of both groups, the presence of diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HT), and multiple comorbidities were significantly higher in the recurrence (+) group (<i>P</i> = 0.038, <i>P</i> = 0.012, <i>P</i> = 0.013). Blood group, postoperative use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, preoperative cystostomy, cause of stricture, iatrogenic cause of stricture, location and length of stricture, indwelling urinary cathater size and day of catheter removal did not differ between the two groups. No statistically significant difference was observed between the two groups in terms of age, uroflowmetric maximum flow rate value, hemogram parameters, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), fasting blood sugar, creatinine, glomerular filtration rate, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, platelet-lymphocyte ratio, lymphocyte-monocyte ratio, monocyte-lymphocyte ratio and AST/ALT ratios. In patients with urethral stricture recurrence, only the frequency of DM and HT was high, while inflammation marker levels and stricture-related parameters were similar between the groups.\n",
            "ID: 38765635, Title: A Comprehensive Review on Weight Gain following Discontinuation of Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor Agonists for Obesity., Abstract: Obesity is considered the leading public health problem in the medical sector. The phenotype includes overweight conditions that lead to several other comorbidities that drastically decrease health. Glucagon-like receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) initially designed for treating type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) had demonstrated weight loss benefits in several clinical trials<i>. In vivo</i> studies showed that GLP-1RA encourages reduced food consumption and consequent weight reduction by stimulating brown fat and enhancing energy outlay through the action of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) pathways. Additionally, GLP-1RAs were found to regulate food intake through stimulation of sensory neurons in the vagus, interaction with the hypothalamus and hindbrain, and through inflammation and intestinal microbiota. However, the main concern with the use of GLP-1RA treatment was weight gain after withdrawal or discontinuation. We could identify three different ways that could lead to weight gain. Potential factors might include temporary hormonal adjustment in response to weight reduction, the central nervous system's (CNS) incompetence in regulating weight augmentation owing to the lack of GLP-1RA, and <i>β</i>-cell malfunction due to sustained exposure to GLP-1RA. Here, we also review the data from clinical studies that reported withdrawal symptoms. Although the use of GLP-1RA could be beneficial in multiple ways, withdrawal after years has the symptoms reversed. Clinical studies should emphasize the downside of these views we highlighted, and mechanistic studies must be carried out for a better outcome with GLP-1RA from the laboratory to the bedside.\n",

The aim of this study is to clarify the genetic background of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) of unknown etiology who initiated renal replacement therapy (RRT) in adulthood. This is a multicenter cross-sectional cohort study. Of the 1164 patients who attended 4 dialysis clinics in Japan, we first selected patients who started RRT between the ages of 20 and 49 years. After excluding patients with apparent causes of CKD (e.g., diabetic nephropathy, polycystic kidney disease (PKD) with family history, patients who underwent renal biopsy), 90 patients with CKD of unknown cause were included. The 298 genes associated with CKD were analyzed using capture-based targeted next-generation sequencing. Of the 90 patients, 10 (11.1%) had pathogenic variants in CKD-causing genes and 17 (18.9%) had variant of unknown significance (VUS). Three patients had <i>PKD1</i> pathogenic variants, and 1 patient had <i>PKD1</i> and <i>COL4A4</i> pathogenic variants. In addition, 2 patients were diagnosed with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) due to <i>C3</i> or <i>CFHR5</i>. One patient each was diagnosed with Alport syndrome due to <i>COL4A4</i> and <i>COL4A3</i> variants<i>,</i> nephronophthisis due to <i>NPHP1</i> variants, Fabry disease due to <i>GLA</i> variants, and autosomal-dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease due to <i>UMOD</i> variants. Genetic diagnoses were not concordant with clinical diagnoses, except for patients with <i>PKD1</i> variant. This largest study on genetic analysis in hemodialysis-dependent adults revealed the presence of undiagnosed inherited kidney diseases.\n",
            "ID: 38765600, Title: Alkaline Phosphatase and Parathyroid Hormone Levels: International Variation and Associations With Clinical Outcomes in the DOPPS., Abstract: Secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) increases the risk of fractures and cardiovascular (CV) disease in patients on hemodialysis (HD). The relationship between parathyroid hormone (PTH) and outcomes has been inconsistent, possibly due to variable bone responsiveness to PTH. The KDIGO guideline suggests monitoring total alkaline phosphatase (ALP), but the role of ALP versus PTH in the management of mineral and bone disorder (MBD) is not clear. The analysis included 28,888 patients on HD in 9 countries in Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study (DOPPS) phase 3 to 7 (2005-2021). The primary exposures of interest were normalized ALP and PTH, which are raw values divided by facility upper normal limit, measured at study enrollment. Cox models were used to estimate hazard ratios of all-cause or CV mortality and any or hip fracture adjusted for potential confounders. Linear mixed models, adjusted for potential confounders, were employed to investigate the relationship between normalized ALP levels and patient characteristics. Normalized PTH showed a J-shaped association with all-cause or CV mortality, and a weak linear association with fracture. In contrast, normalized ALP showed a strong association with all outcomes. Factors associated with higher ALP levels after controlling for PTH included Black race, longer dialysis vintage, diabetes mellitus, hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), and the use of cinacalcet. Total ALP is a more robust exposure of adverse outcomes than PTH in patients on HD. PTH responsiveness is affected by race, primary renal disease, comorbidities, and mineral metabolism and therapy. Our results indicate that it may be useful to evaluate target organ response, rather than PTH alone when considering the consequences of (SHPT).\n",
            "ID: 38765561, Title: Calciphylaxis Episodes in the Australia and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant Registry., Abstract: Calciphylaxis is a rare disorder associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Data registries are an invaluable source of information for rare diseases. We reviewed cases of calciphylaxis recorded in the Australia and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant Registry (ANZDATA) and evaluated associations and outcomes of this condition. Data was obtained on all cases of calciphylaxis reported between 2019 and 2022 in Australian and New Zealand patients on kidney replacement therapy (KRT). This cohort was compared to all patients in the registry who received KRT from 2019 to 2022 without an episode of calciphylaxis. Cox proportional hazards regression including a time-varying covariate for calciphylaxis episode was conducted for mortality with models restricted to patients on dialysis only. From 2019 to 2022, 333 patients had calciphylaxis episodes reported. Overall incidence rate for patients on dialysis was 4.5 (4.1-5.1) episodes per 1000 patient-years on dialysis. Median age was 63 (interquartile range [IQR]: 55-73) years, 54% were female, 66% had diabetes, 59% were obese (body mass index [BMI] ≥ 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and 77% were receiving hemodialysis (HD) treatment. Compared to patients without calciphylaxis (<i>n</i> = 46,526), patients with calciphylaxis were more likely to be older, female, and have diabetes, greater BMI, coronary artery, and peripheral vascular disease. The median time to calciphylaxis was 3.2 (IQR: 0.9-6.7) years after KRT commencement. Half of the patients with calciphylaxis died by 12 months from diagnosis. Adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of mortality for patients on dialysis with calciphylaxis <1 year and 1 to 4 years after an episode was 5.8 (4.9-6.9) and 1.5 (1.0-2.1), respectively compared to patients on dialysis without calciphylaxis. Calciphylaxis is a rare but life-threatening condition in people on KRT with the greatest mortality burden within 12 months of diagnosis.\n",

A total of 485 PLWH were enrolled. These participants were categorized into two groups based on the estimated pulse wave velocity (ePWV) level. Demographic and clinical data were collected to investigate the correlation between ePWV and MetS. The cohort of 485 PLWH was categorized into high-ePWV and low-ePWV groups based on ePWV cutoff value of 10 m/s. We observed significant differences in components of MetS including triglycerides (TG, P < 0.05), HDL cholesterol (HDL-C, P < 0.01), systolic blood pressure (SBP, P < 0.001), diastolic blood pressure (DBP, P < 0.05), and fasting plasma glucose (FPG, P < 0.001) between the two groups. Furthermore, we employed receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves to demonstrate the effectiveness of ePWV as a predictive indicator for MetS in PLWH (AUC = 0.739, P < 0.001). According to the ROC curve, the optimal cut-off value of ePWV was 7.4 m/s, and its sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing MetS in PLWH were 79.03% and 64.07%, respectively. Although the 7.4 m/s cutoff increased the false positive rate compared to the traditional cutoff, it significantly reduced the rate of missed diagnoses, effectively identifying 79.03% of PLWH with MetS. ePWV is a non-invasive and convenient novel biomarker with predictive capabilities for MetS in PLWH.\n",

            "ID: 38765466, Title: Racial inequities and rare <i>CFTR</i> variants: Impact on cystic fibrosis diagnosis and treatment., Abstract: Cystic fibrosis (CF) has been traditionally viewed as a disease that affects White individuals. However, CF occurs among all races, ethnicities, and geographic ancestries. The disorder results from mutations in the <i>CF transmembrane conductance regulator</i> (<i>CFTR</i>). Varying incidence of CF is reported among Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC), who typically exhibit worse clinical outcomes. These populations are more likely to carry rare <i>CFTR</i> variants omitted from newborn screening panels, leading to disparities in care such as delayed diagnosis and treatment. In this study, we present a case-in-point describing an individual of Gambian descent identified with CF. Patient genotype includes a premature termination codon (PTC) (c.2353C>T) and previously undescribed single nucleotide deletion (c.1970delG), arguing against effectiveness of currently available CFTR modulator-based interventions. Strategies for overcoming these two variants will likely include combinations of PTC suppressors, nonsense mediated decay inhibitors, and/or alternative approaches (e.g. gene therapy). Investigations such as the present study establish a foundation from which therapeutic treatments may be developed. Importantly, c.2353C>T and c.1970delG were not detected in the patient by traditional <i>CFTR</i> screening panels, which include an implicit racial and ethnic diagnostic bias as these tests are comprised of mutations largely observed in people of European ancestry. We suggest that next-generation sequencing of <i>CFTR</i> should be utilized to confirm or exclude a CF diagnosis, in order to equitably serve BIPOC individuals. Additional epidemiologic data, basic science investigations, and translational work are imperative for improving understanding of disease prevalence and progression, <i>CFTR</i> variant frequency, genotype-phenotype correlation, pharmacologic responsiveness, and personalized medicine approaches for patients with African ancestry and other historically understudied geographic lineages.\n",
            "ID: 38765429, Title: Interplay Between Diabetes Mellitus and the Occurrence of Osteoarthritis and Associated Conditions in Women of Menopausal Age., Abstract: Osteoarthritis (OA) and diabetes mellitus (DM) have long-term deleterious chronic effects and are among the most prevalent chronic disorders. DM and its associated factors, such as hyperglycemia, have a significant contribution to the pathophysiology of OA, particularly in post-menopausal women. Women who have uncontrolled diabetes (DM) are more prone to develop osteoarthritis (OA), which may be exacerbated by poor glycemic control. Furthermore, this category of female patients with DM has an increased risk of developing fractures, even in those with initially normal bone density scores, further illustrating the correlation between DM and bone health. Additionally, multiple risk factors, including obesity, metabolic syndrome, hypertension, estrogen-based hormone therapy, and hyperuricemia, in menopausal women can lead to the development and exacerbation of OA. It is discovered that these variables have a direct or indirect impact, frequently causing inflammation and hormonal changes, which contribute to the intricate interaction between DM and OA. The management of OA and DM in women thus calls for a multi-faceted management plan including glycemic control, weight control, exercise, and specialized pain management methods catering to the specific requirements of the patients. Regularly screening for OA should be implemented for menopausal women with DM and utmost care should be provided by healthcare professionals. Regular monitoring of joint health and early management, encouraging interdisciplinary cooperation, putting preventative measures into place, and creating individualized treatment programs are essential. A thorough understanding of the link between DM and OA will ultimately lead to improved health outcomes and a better future for these individuals.\n",
            "ID: 38765423, Title: Assessment of the Level of Knowledge About Risk Factors, Prevention, and Treatment of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus in a Community Sample From Saudi Arabia., Abstract: Introduction Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a common disease affecting pregnant females, and it carries a major risk of short and long-term health problems for both mothers and their offspring. Multiple factors like advanced maternal age, obesity, and unhealthy lifestyle can increase the risk of GDM. The current guidelines recommend screening all pregnant females for risk factors during the first trimester with subsequent testing of the blood glucose level at 24 weeks gestation. Lack of awareness about GDM is a main contributing factor in the delay in screening and diagnosis of GDM with subsequent fetal and maternal complications. This study aims to identify the level of knowledge about GDM among the adult population in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). Material and methods A descriptive cross-sectional questionnaire-based study was conducted to identify the level of knowledge about risk factors, prevention, and treatment of GDM in a community sample from Saudi Arabia. A self-administered electronic questionnaire was designed, tested for validity and reliability, and distributed through social media platforms. It consisted of 18 questions asking about the socio-demographic characteristics, the type of hospital in which the participant receives their medical care, whether the participant heard about GDM or not, and if they know someone with GDM, in addition to questions to assess the level of knowledge about risk factors, complications, prevention, and treatment of GDM. The total score of knowledge was calculated. The multivariate regression analysis test was employed to analyze the relationship between various demographic variables and the level of knowledge about GDM among the study population. A p-value of 0.05 or less was considered statistically significant. Results A total of 539 (100%) participants completed the questionnaire: 263 (48.8%) of them were in the age category (18-25 years), 440 (81.6%) of them were females, 307 (57%) had a bachelor's degree, 275 (51%) were single, 454 (84.2%) had heard about GDM, and 258 (47.9%) of them have or know someone with GDM. The total score of knowledge revealed excellent, good, fair, and poor levels among 334 (62%), 140 (26%), 49 (9%), and 16 (3%) of participants, respectively. The multivariable linear regression model revealed that participants who received health care from governmental hospitals heard about GDM and had or knew someone with GDM were positively associated with a higher level of knowledge. Conclusions The findings revealed that among participants, 62% showed excellent knowledge about GDM, although, the other 38% had non-optimal levels of knowledge. Awareness campaigns are recommended to improve the level of knowledge about this disease, its risk factors, treatment, and complications.\n",
            "ID: 38765344, Title: A Study to Evaluate the Effect of Sodium-Glucose Co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) Inhibitors on Oxidative Stress Parameters in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients., Abstract: Introduction Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a global health issue with 50 million diabetics currently residing in India. Hyperglycemia causes tissue damage due to mitochondrial overproduction of reactive oxygen species. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors (SGLT2i) have shown a decrease in oxidative stress by either amelioration of free-radical generation or potentiation of cellular antioxidative capacity in preclinical studies. However, there is a paucity of published clinical studies. Hence, this study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of co-administration of SGLT2i with other drugs on oxidative stress in type 2 DM (T2DM) patients. Methods A prospective, parallel, open-label study in T2DM patients attending endocrinology OPD was conducted for a period of 12 months. At the clinician's discretion, patients were grouped as SGLT2i as an add-on to standard drugs vs standard drugs alone. Blood samples were collected at baseline and at the end of 12 weeks to estimate malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO), and glutathione (GSH) levels. Secondary parameters - glycemic indices and lipid profile - were estimated every four weeks. Results A total of 32 patients were enrolled in the study (16 per group). There was a significant decrease in MDA (p < 0.05) and NO (p < 0.01) and a highly significant increase in GSH (p < 0.001) at 12 weeks from baseline in the SGLT2i group. A reduction in fasting blood sugar (FBS) and post-prandial blood sugar (PPBS) and a 0.56% difference in HbA1c were also noted in the SGLT2i group. Significant lowering of low-density lipoprotein (LDL, p < 0.05) and elevation in HDL levels (p < 0.05) from baseline was seen in the SGLT2i group.  Conclusion Co-administration of SGLT2i with antidiabetic drugs demonstrated a significant effect in improving oxidative stress biomarkers and glycemic and lipid profiles among T2DM patients.\n",
            "ID: 38765207, Title: Exploring the Impact of Iron Deficiency Anaemia on Glycated Haemoglobin A1c Levels in Pregnant and Non-Pregnant Women: A Systematic Review., Abstract: Haemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) is fundamental in monitoring glycaemic control during pregnancy. However, several conditions could affect this test's accuracy, including iron deficiency anaemia (IDA). Hence, this systematic review delves into the underexplored connection between IDA, iron replacement therapy (IRT), and haemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) during pregnancy. An electronic search of the Cochrane, MEDLINE, and Embase databases was conducted by six authors. From a comprehensive search strategy, 968 records were obtained. After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, seven studies were included, comprising 365 women selected for analysis. Six studies indicated a positive correlation between IDA and HbA1c levels, while one found no correlation. The average HbA1c level of the included studies in pregnant women was 5.64%. In comparison, it was found that non-pregnant women had lower HbA1c levels. Among the included studies, the mean HbA1c levels decreased from 5.1% to 4.89% after treating pregnant women with IRT. The review emphasises the complexity of interpreting HbA1c levels in pregnant women with IDA, highlighting the influence of pregnancy-induced physiological changes. In addition, this suggests that HbA1c should not be the sole criterion for diabetes management in pregnant women with IDA. Future research should focus on alternative glycaemic monitoring methods unaffected by IDA.\n",

Motor nerve conduction velocity (CV) slowing in diabetic DSP exceeds expectations for pure axonal loss thus implicating superimposed acquired demyelination. After establishing demyelination confidence intervals by regression analysis of nerve conduction data from chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), we prospectively studied CV slowing in 90 diabetic DSP patients with and without at least one motor nerve exhibiting CV slowing (groups A and B) into the demyelination range by American Academy of Neurology (AAN) criteria respectively and 95 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients. Simultaneously, secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) activity was assessed in both diabetic groups and 46 healthy controls. No ALS patient exhibited CV slowing in more than two motor nerves based on AAN criteria or the confidence intervals. Group A demonstrated a significantly higher percentage of patients as compared to group B fulfilling the above criteria, with an additional criterion of at least one motor nerve exhibiting CV slowing in the demyelinating range and a corresponding F response in the demyelinating range by AAN criteria (70.3 % <i>vs.</i> 1.9 %; p < 0.0001). Urine sPLA2 activity was increased significantly in diabetic groups as compared to healthy controls (942.9 ± 978.0 <i>vs.</i> 591.6 ± 390.2 pmol/min/ml, p < 0.05), and in group A compared to Group B (1328.3 ± 1274.2 <i>vs.</i> 673.8 ± 576.9 pmol/min/ml, p < 0.01). More patients with elevated sPLA2 activity and more than 2 motor nerves with CV slowing in the AAN or the confidence intervals were identified in group A as compared to group B (35.1 % <i>vs.</i> 5.7 %, p < 0.001). Furthermore, 13.5 % of patients in diabetic DSP Group A, and no patients in diabetic DSP Group B, fulfilled an additional criterion of more than one motor nerve with CV slowing into the demyelinating range with its corresponding F response into the demyelinating range by AAN criteria. A combination of regression analysis of electrodiagnostic data and a urine biological marker of systemic inflammation identifies a subgroup of diabetic DSP with superimposed acquired demyelination that may respond favorably to immunomodulatory therapy.\n",
            "ID: 38765055, Title: Towards Integrated Care for the Elderly: Exploring the Acceptability of Telemonitoring for Hypertension and Type 2 Diabetes Management., Abstract: Telemonitoring has been proposed as an effective method to support integrated care for older people with hypertension and type 2 diabetes. This paper examines acceptability of telemontioring, its role in supporting integrated care, and identifies scale-up barriers. A concurrent triangulation mixed-methods study, including in-depth interviews (n = 29) and quantitative acceptability tool (n = 55) was conducted among individuals who underwent a 12-month telemonitoring routine. The research was guided by the Theoretical Framework of Acceptability. Interviews were analysed using template content analysis (TCA). TCA identified seven domains of acceptability, with twenty-one subthemes influencing it positively or negatively. In the quantitative survey, acceptability was high across all seven domains with an overall score of 4.4 out of 5. Urban regions showed higher acceptability than rural regions (4.5 vs. 4.3), with rural participants perceiving initial training and participation effort as significantly more burdensome than their urban counterparts. Patients described several instances where telemonitoring supported self-management, education, treatment, and identification elements of the integrated care package. However, there were barriers that may limit its further scale-up. For further scale-up, it is important to screen patients for monitoring eligibility, adapt telemonitoring devices to elderly needs, combine telemonitoring with health education, involve family members, and establish follow-up programmes.\n",
            "ID: 38765022, Title: Integrating Network Pharmacology and Molecular Docking Approach to Elucidate the Mechanism of <i>Commiphora wightii</i> for the Treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis., Abstract: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is considered a notable prolonged inflammatory condition with no proper cure. Synovial inflammation and synovial pannus are crucial in the onset of RA. The \"tumor-like\" invading proliferation of new arteries is a keynote of RA. Commiphora wightii (<i>C wightii</i>) is a perennial, deciduous, and trifoliate plant used in several areas of southeast Asia to cure numerous ailments, including arthritis, diabetes, obesity, and asthma. Several <i>in vitro</i> investigations have indicated <i>C wightii's</i> therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of arthritis. However, the precise molecular action is yet unknown. In this study, a network pharmacology approach was applied to uncover potential targets, active therapeutic ingredients and signaling pathways in <i>C wightii</i> for the treatment of arthritis. In the groundwork of this research, we examined the active constituent-compound-target-pathway network and evaluated that (Guggulsterol-V, Myrrhahnone B, and Campesterol) decisively donated to the development of arthritis by affecting tumor necrosis factor (TNF), PIK3CA, and MAPK3 genes. Later on, docking was employed to confirm the active components' efficiency against the potential targets. According to molecular-docking research, several potential targets of RA bind tightly with the corresponding key active ingredient of <i>C wightii.</i> With the aid of network pharmacology techniques, we conclude that the signaling pathways and biological processes involved in <i>C wightii</i> had an impact on the prevention of arthritis. The outcomes of molecular docking also serve as strong recommendations for future research. In the context of this study, network pharmacology combined with molecular docking analysis showed that <i>C wightii</i> acted on arthritis-related signaling pathways to exhibit a promising preventive impact on arthritis. These results serve as the basis for grasping the mechanism of the antiarthritis activity of <i>C wightii</i>. However, further <i>in vivo</i>/<i>in vitro</i> study is needed to verify the reliability of these targets for the treatment of arthritis.\n",

Although an anion gap (AG) ≤12 mEq/L is recommended before transition to SQ insulin, there are limited data to support this threshold. <b>Objective:</b> To compare the rates of successful transitions to SQ insulin in patients with DKA with an AG ≤ 12 mEq/L versus > 12 mEq/L. <b>Methods:</b> Retrospective cohort study of adult critically ill patients with moderate to severe DKA between September 2019 and December 2022. The primary outcome was the success of insulin transition between patients transitioned with an AG ≤ 12 mEq/L and those transitioned with an AG > 12 mEq/L. Transition was considered successful if the AG did not increase above the value at transition at 24 hours and insulin infusion was not restarted. Secondary outcomes include the individual components of the primary outcome and ICU length of stay (LOS); safety outcomes included hypoglycemia and electrolyte derangements. <b>Results:</b> In total, 92 patients were included, with 43 patients transitioned at AG ≤ 12 mEq/L and 49 patients transitioned at AG > 12 mEq/L. Transition was unsuccessful in 3 patients (7%) with AG ≤ 12 mEq/L and 2 patients (4%) with AG > 12 mEq/L (<i>P</i> = .66). There was no difference in the incidence of the individual components of this outcome between groups or in safety outcomes. <b>Conclusion:</b> This retrospective study showed no difference in success of insulin transition between the groups. Larger studies are needed to evaluate the impact of treatment characteristics on transition success and patient outcomes.\n",

Despite being potentially fatal, this infection causes minor changes in inflammatory biomarkers (white blood cell count and C-reactive protein levels) upon blood testing. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging changes persist over a long period. Therefore, it is difficult to determine the optimal time for the discontinuation of antibiotics. We present a 77-year-old male whose medical history included type 2 diabetes mellitus who suffered from chronic otitis media with Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. His condition did not improve with proper treatment, and imaging revealed malignant otitis media. Intravenous cefepime treatment was administered. Antibiotic treatment was de-escalated to oral levofloxacin treatment after Gallium-67 scintigraphy showed less accumulation after 6 weeks of Cefepime administration; accumulation almost disappeared after 1 year. In this report, we describe the usefulness of gallium scintigraphy in the evaluation of malignant otitis externa.\n",

Although cemiplimab shows excellent efficacy with a good tolerability profile, it can cause side effects, including potentially life-threatening endocrinopathies. We discuss the case of a 77-year-old Caucasian female with CSCC treated with only three cycles of cemiplimab who presented with altered mental status and was found to have severe hyperglycemia, hyperosmolarity, ketonemia, glucosuria, and ketonuria concerning for hyperosmolar hyperglycemic syndrome (HHS) with concurrent diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The patient made a rapid recovery in the hospital while on standard therapies for HHS/DKA and cemiplimab was discontinued upon discharge. While there have been reports of cemiplimab-induced DKA, to our knowledge, this is the first reported case of cemiplimab-induced HHS-DKA. This report aims to shed light on cemiplimab-induced HHS-DKA and to underscore the need to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying ICI-induced diabetes mellitus (ICI-DM).\n",
            "ID: 38764667, Title: Novel Insights in the Hypertension Treatment & Type 2 Diabetics Induced by Angiotensin Receptor Blockers: MD Simulation Studies & Molecular Docking of Some Promising Natural Therapies., Abstract: Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are commonly used to treat hypertension that target the hormonal system (renin-angiotensin system (RAS)), which regulates various physiological functions in the body. ARBs work by blocking the binding of angiotensin II to its receptor, thereby preventing a rise in blood pressure. These drugs not only normalize the overactivation of RAS but also provide protective effects against cardiovascular, renal, and type 2 diabetic patients. Inappropriate RAS activity has been linked to insulin resistance of type 2 diabetes. Olmesartan, as an ARB, was found to have a beneficial role in reducing postprandial glucose levels in type 2 diabetes. However, ARBs can cause side effects, prompting a search for new compounds that have fewer adverse effects. This study explores the potential of natural metabolites, specifically eugenol, gallic acid, myricetin, <i>p</i>-cymene, quercetin, and kaempferol, as ARB inhibitors compared to the current standard, olmesartan. Using in silico studies, the binding affinity of these natural substances to the ARB receptor was evaluated. The results showed that myricetin and kaempferol had affinities higher than those of olmesartan, suggesting that they could serve as promising ARB inhibitors for hypertension treatment. These natural compounds could provide an alternative approach to conventional antihypertensive drugs, which may have fewer side effects. However, more research is needed to validate the efficacy and safety of these natural compounds as antihypertensive drugs. Further in vitro and in vivo studies are needed to confirm their effectiveness and safety. This study provides a promising starting point for future investigations into the potential of natural metabolites as alternative treatments for hypertension. The findings also highlight the importance of exploring natural alternative treatments for hypertension and the protective effects of ARBs on early stage type-2 diabetics.\n",
            "ID: 38764602, Title: Mind the Gap in Kidney Care: Translating What We Know Into What We do., Abstract: Historically, it takes an average of 17 years to move new treatments from clinical evidence to daily practice. Given the highly effective treatments now available to prevent or delay kidney disease onset and progression, this is far too long. The time is now to narrow the gap between what we know and what we do. Clear guidelines exist for the prevention and management of common risk factors for kidney disease, such as hypertension and diabetes, but only a fraction of people with these conditions worldwide are diagnosed, and even fewer are treated to target. Similarly, the vast majority of people living with kidney disease are unaware of their condition, because in the early stages, it is often silent. Even among patients who have been diagnosed, many do not receive appropriate treatment for kidney disease. Considering the serious consequences of kidney disease progression, kidney failure, or death, it is imperative that treatments are initiated early and appropriately. Opportunities to diagnose and treat kidney disease early must be maximized beginning at the primary-care level. Many systematic barriers exist, ranging from patient to clinician to health systems to societal factors. To preserve and improve kidney health for everyone everywhere, each of these barriers must be acknowledged so that sustainable solutions are developed and implemented without further delay.\n",

Burosumab is a recombinant human monoclonal antibody that inhibits FGF23, restoring patient serum phosphate levels. Safety data on long-term burosumab treatment are currently limited. This post-authorization safety study (PASS) aims to monitor long-term safety outcomes in children and adolescents (1-17 years) treated with burosumab for XLH. This first interim analysis reports the initial PASS safety outcomes. A 10-year retrospective and prospective cohort study. This PASS utilizes International XLH Registry (NCT03193476) data, which includes standard diagnostic and monitoring practice data at participating European centers. At data cut-off (13 May 2021), 647 participants were included in the International XLH Registry; 367 were receiving burosumab, of which 67 provided consent to be included in the PASS. Mean (SD) follow-up time was 2.2 (1.0) years. Mean (SD) age was 7.3 (4.3) years (range 1.0-17.5 years). Mean duration of burosumab exposure was 29.7 (25.0) months. Overall, 25/67 participants (37.3%) experienced ⩾1 adverse event (AE) during follow-up; 83 AEs were reported. There were no deaths, no AEs leading to treatment withdrawal, nor serious AEs related to treatment. The most frequently reported AEs were classified as 'musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders', with 'pain in extremity' most frequently reported, followed by 'infections and infestations', with 'tooth abscess' the most frequently reported. In this first interim analysis of the PASS, covering the initial 2 years of data collection, the safety profile of burosumab is consistent with previously reported safety data. The PASS will provide long-term safety data over its 10-year duration for healthcare providers and participants with XLH that contribute to improvements in the knowledge of burosumab safety.

A prospective study, conducted between March 2021 and July 2022, including 60 men with type 2 diabetes, aged 40-65 years, statin-free, and in whom treatment with high-intensity statin was indicated. The patients had two visits, before and 6 months after a daily intake of 40 mg of atorvastatin. During each visit, they underwent a clinical examination, and a fasting blood sample was collected for biological and hormonal measurements. There was a significant increase in the prevalence of decreased libido (from 22% to 47%, p = 0.001) and a significant decrease in the frequency of sexual intercourse (from 4 [1-8] to 3 [0-4] per month, p = 0.005). The median ADAM's score significantly increased (from 4 [2-7] to 6 [3-8], p = 0.000). Twenty-two percent of the patients developed gynecomastia. The median total, bioavailable and free testosterone significantly decreased from 15.1 (11.4-17.4), 6.3 (5.0-7.8), and 0.27 (0.22-0.33) nmol/L to 12.7 (10.7-15.9), 5.7 (4.4-7.0), and 0.24 (0.19-0.30) nmol/L, respectively, with no change in FSH and LH levels. Three patients (5%) developed hypogonadism (testosterone <8 nmol/L). There was a significant decrease in DHEAS from 4.5 (2.8-6.1) to 3.8 μmol/L (2.6-5.6) and no change in cortisol and vitamin D levels. High-intensity statin therapy decreased androgen levels in type 2 diabetic men with significant clinical impact.\n",

We included 438 patients with CKD (GLP-1RA-first group, n = 223; SGLT2 inhibitor-first group, n = 215) from the 643 T2D patients in the RECAP study. The incidence of the composite renal outcome, defined as progression to macroalbuminuria and/or a ≥50% decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), was analysed using a propensity score (PS)-matched model. Furthermore, we calculated the win ratio for these composite renal outcomes, which were weighted in the following order: (1) both a ≥50% decrease in eGFR and progression to macroalbuminuria; (2) a decrease in eGFR of ≥50% only; and (3) progression to macroalbuminuria only. Using the PS-matched model, 132 patients from each group were paired. The incidence of renal composite outcomes did not differ between the two groups (GLP-1RA-first group, 10%; SGLT2 inhibitor-first group, 17%; odds ratio 1.80; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.85 to 4.26; p = 0.12). The win ratio of the GLP-1RA-first group versus the SGLT2 inhibitor-first group was 1.83 (95% CI 1.71 to 1.95; p < 0.001). Although the renal composite outcome did not differ between the two groups, the win ratio of the GLP-1RA-first group versus the SGLT2 inhibitor-first group was significant. These results suggest that, in GLP-1RA and SGLT2 inhibitor combination therapy, the addition of an SGLT2 inhibitor to baseline GLP-1RA treatment may lead to more favourable renal outcomes.\n",
            "ID: 38764311, Title: Transcriptomics reveals transient and dynamic muscle fibrosis and atrophy differences following spinal cord injury in rats., Abstract: The rate and magnitude of skeletal muscle wasting after severe spinal cord injury (SCI) exceeds most other disuse conditions. Assessing the time course of molecular changes can provide insight into the progression of muscle wasting post-SCI. The goals of this study were (1) to identify potential targets that may prevent the pathologic features of SCI in soleus muscles and (2) to establish therapeutic windows for treating these pathologic changes. Four-month-old Sprague-Dawley male rats received T9 laminectomy (SHAM surgery) or severe contusion SCI. Hindlimb locomotor function was assessed weekly, with soleus muscles obtained 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month and 3 months post-surgery (n = 6-7 per group per timepoint). RNA was extracted from muscles for bulk RNA-sequencing analysis (n = 3-5 per group per timepoint). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were evaluated between age-matched SHAM and SCI animals. Myofiber size, muscle fibre type and fibrosis were assessed on contralateral muscles. SCI produced immediate and persistent hindlimb paralysis, with Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan locomotor scores remaining below 7 throughout the study, contributing to a progressive 25-50% lower soleus mass and myofiber atrophy versus SHAM (P < 0.05 at all timepoints). Transcriptional comparisons of SCI versus SHAM resulted in 184 DEGs (1 week), 436 DEGs (2 weeks), 133 DEGs (1 month) and 1200 DEGs (3 months). Upregulated atrophy-related genes included those associated with cell senescence, nuclear factor kappa B, ubiquitin proteasome and unfolded protein response pathways, along with upregulated genes that negatively influence muscle growth through the transforming growth factor beta pathway and inhibition of insulin-like growth factor-I/Akt/mechanistic target of rapamycin and p38/mitogen-activated protein kinase signalling. Genes associated with extracellular matrix (ECM), including collagens, collagen crosslinkers, proteoglycans and those regulating ECM integrity, were enriched within upregulated DEGs at 1 week but subsequently downregulated at 2 weeks and 3 months and were accompanied by >50% higher ECM areas and hydroxyproline levels in SCI muscles (P < 0.05). Myofiber remodelling genes were enriched in upregulated DEGs at 2 weeks and 1 month and were downregulated at 3 months. Genes that regulate neuromuscular junction remodelling were evident in muscles post-SCI, along with slow-to-fast fibre-type shifts: 1 week and 2 weeks SCI muscles were composed of 90% myosin heavy chain (MHC) type I fibres, which decreased to only 16% at 3 months and were accompanied by 50% fibres containing MHC IIX (P < 0.05). Metabolism genes were enriched in upregulated DEGs at 1 month and were further enriched at 3 months. Our results substantiate many known pathologic features of SCI-induced wasting in rat skeletal muscle and identify a progressive and dynamic transcriptional landscape within the post-SCI soleus. Future studies are warranted to consider these therapeutic treatment windows when countering SCI muscle pathology.\n",
            "ID: 38764270, Title: Comparison of clinical and microbiological characteristics of community-acquired hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae liver abscess in diabetic and non-diabetic patients., Abstract: Invasive infection caused by hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae (HvKP) has been reported worldwide. Most of the patients are community population, related to diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic liver disease and other basic diseases, which prone to systemic migratory infection. In this study, we collected 377 patients with community acquired Klebsiella pneumoniae liver abscess in our hospital from January 2013 to December 2018, 65.8% of whom were male, and 49.6% had DM. Patients with DM are prone to eye and central nervous system (CNS) infection, which need continuous local abscess drainage during treatment. Among them, patients with poor blood glucose control have a higher rate of blood stream infections (BSI). 219 strains of HvKP were obtained, with K1/K2 Serotype accounted for 81.7%. The incidence of BSI in K2 patients was higher than that in K1 patients. The PCR results indicate that the carrying rate of virulence genes (rmpA、areo、kfu、allS、iroN、magA、uge、wcaG) in K1/K2 type strains is significantly higher than that in non K1/K2 type strains. ST23 and ST65 are the most common multilocus sequence typing (MLST), which belong to K1 and K2 Serotype respectively. All of HvKP strains showed high sensitivity to commonly used clinical antibiotics other than ampicillin, with 54.3% of the strains exhibiting high viscosity characteristics. Meanwhile, 35 classic Klebsiella pneumoniae (cKP) strains were collected, and their serum typing is mainly non K1/K2. The carrying rate of virulence genes and viscosity degree in HvKP are significantly higher than those in cKP. Primary liver abscess caused by HvKP is prone to multiple tissue and organ infections, but it shows higher sensitivity to most commonly used antibiotics in clinical practice except for ampicillin. After effective treatment, the overall prognosis of patients is better. This study analyzes the pathogenic characteristics of HvKP and elaborates on the clinical characteristics of patients, which can provide reference for clinical and scientific research work.\n",
            "ID: 38764169, Title: Biosynthesis, characterization, and anticoagulant properties of copper nanoparticles from red seaweed of Acanthophora sp., Abstract: In the last few decades, nanoparticles have found extensive use in a variety of biological applications. Traditional medicine widely uses Acanthophora sp., a marine macroalgae, to cure and prevent diabetes, skin disorders, and blood clotting. The present study aims to investigate whether green-synthesized copper nanoparticles (CuNPs) might work as an anticoagulant. The CuNPs were made using an environmentally friendly method that uses Acanthophora extract. We used UV-vis spectroscopy to assess the surface plasmon resonance of the material, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to analyze its form, and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy to identify the material's constituent elements. Furthermore, Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) determined the functional groups of the CuNPs. The biosynthesis of CuNPs was confirmed by UV-vis spectroscopy, which showed a surface plasmon resonance peak at 570 nm. The FT-IR analysis showed that certain functional groups are involved in the formation of CuNPs. These groups include OH stretching, C=O stretching, C-H bonding, C-N bonding, and Cu vibration. SEM analysis demonstrated the morphology of CuNPs synthesized, with a size of 0.5 μm, while EDS analysis confirmed their purity. The anticoagulant activity of prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) assays showed that the clotting time got longer depending on the concentration. The CuNPs synthesized from Acanthophora had strong anticoagulant effects at 100 μg/mL, further suggesting that they might be useful as a natural blood thinner. The interesting thing we observed is that the green-synthesized CuNPs made from Acanthophora extract could be used in anticoagulation therapy.\n",
            "ID: 38764099, Title: [Clinical effect of acupuncture combined with medication on diabetic peripheral neuropathy and its influence on serum lipid metabolism]., Abstract: To observe the clinical effect on diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) treated with acupuncture combined with medication and explore its effect mechanism. Sixty-two patients of DPN were randomly divided into a combined therapy group (31 cases) and a medication group (31 cases, 2 cases dropped out); besides, 20 healthy subjects were recruited as a normal group. On the base of routine intervention, in the medication group, thioctic acid capsules were administrated orally, 0.2 g each time, 3 times a day. In the combined therapy group, besides the medication as the medication group, acupuncture was performed on bilateral Quchi (LI 11), Waiguan (TE 5), Hegu (LI 4), Tianshu (ST 25), Zusanli (ST 36), Sanyinjiao (SP 6) and Taichong (LR 3) and the needles were retained for 30 min, acupuncture was delivered once daily, 6 times a week. The duration of treatment was 4 weeks in the two groups. The score of Toronto clinical scoring system (TCSS), the nerve conduction velocity of median nerve (MN) and common peroneal nerve (CPN) were observed before and after treatment in the two intervention groups; and the serum lipid metabolism was detected before and after treatment in the two intervention groups and the normal group. Compared with that before treatment, the scores of TCSS were reduced in the combined therapy group and the medication group (<i>P</i><0.05) after treatment, and the score decrease in the combined therapy group was larger than that of the medication group (<i>P</i><0.001). The motor nerve conduction velocity and the sensory nerve conductive velocity of MN and CPN after treatment all increased in the combined therapy group and the medication group compared with those before treatment (<i>P</i><0.05), and the improvements in the combined therapy group were larger than those of the medication group (<i>P</i><0.001). Before treatment DPN patients had 365 differential lipid metabolites, including sphingosine (SPH, d18:0), involved in the inositol phosphate metabolism, compared with the subjects of the normal group. There were 103 differential lipid metabolites in the medication group before and after treatment, including lysophosphatidyl ethanolamine (LPE, 18:1/0:0), participated in glycerophospholipid metabolism. In the combined therapy group, before and after treatment, there were 99 differential lipid metabolites, including lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC, 18:0/0:0), participated in the neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction. Acupuncture greatly affected 50 lipid metabolites such as lysophosphatidic acid (LPA, 0:0/22:6), LPA(0:0/18:2) and LPC(O-18:0), which was mainly involved in glycerophospholipid metabolism. Acupuncture combined with medication ameliorates the symptoms and the nerve conduction velocity in DPN patients, which may be related to the regulation of serum lipid metabolism.\n",
            "ID: 38764043, Title: Association of genetic variants related to combined lipid-lowering and antihypertensive therapies with risk of cardiovascular disease: 2 × 2 factorial Mendelian randomization analyses., Abstract: Lipid-lowering drugs and antihypertensive drugs are commonly combined for cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, the relationship of combined medications with CVD remains controversial. We aimed to explore the associations of genetically proxied medications of lipid-lowering and antihypertensive drugs, either alone or both, with risk of CVD, other clinical and safety outcomes. We divided 423,821 individuals in the UK Biobank into 4 groups via median genetic scores for targets of lipid-lowering drugs and antihypertensive drugs: lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) mediated by targets of statins or proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors, lower systolic blood pressure (SBP) mediated by targets of β-blockers (BBs) or calcium channel blockers (CCBs), combined genetically lower LDL-C and SBP, and reference (genetically both higher LDL-C and SBP). Associations with risk of CVD and other clinical outcomes were explored among each group in factorial Mendelian randomization. Independent and additive effects were observed between genetically proxied medications of lipid-lowering and antihypertensive drugs with CVD (including coronary artery disease, stroke, and peripheral artery diseases) and other clinical outcomes (ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, heart failure, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and dementia) (P > 0.05 for interaction in all outcomes). Take the effect of PCSK9 inhibitors and BBs on CVD for instance: compared with the reference, PCSK9 group had a 4% lower risk of CVD (odds ratio [OR], 0.96; 95%CI, 0.94-0.99), and a 3% lower risk was observed in BBs group (OR, 0.97; 95%CI, 0.94-0.99), while combined both were associated with a 6% additively lower risk (OR, 0.94; 95%CI, 0.92-0.97; P = 0.87 for interaction). Genetically proxied medications of combined lipid-lowering and antihypertensive drugs have an independent and additive effects on CVD, other clinical and safety outcomes, with implications for CVD clinical practice, subsequent trials as well as drug development of polypills.\n",
            "ID: 38764010, Title: NSUN2 affects diabetic retinopathy progression by regulating MUC1 expression through RNA m<sup>5</sup>C methylation., Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the leading cause of blinding eye disease among working adults and is primarily attributed to the excessive proliferation of microvessels, which leads to vitreous hemorrhage and retinal traction, thereby significantly impairing patient vision. NSUN2-mediated RNA m<sup>5</sup>C methylation is implicated in various diseases, and in this investigation, we focused on elucidating the impact of NSUN2 on the regulation of the expression of the downstream gene MUC1, specifically through RNA m<sup>5</sup>C methylation, on the progression of DR. Utilizing Microarray analysis, we examined patient vitreous fluid to pinpoint potential therapeutic targets for DR. Differential expression of NSUN2 was validated through qRT-PCR, Western blot, and immunofluorescence in human tissue, animal tissue, and cell model of DR. The relationship between NSUN2 and DR was explored in vitro and in vivo through gene knockdown and overexpression. Various techniques, such as MeRIP-qPCR and dot blot, were applied to reveal the downstream targets and mechanism of action of NSUN2. The levels of both NSUN2 and RNA m<sup>5</sup>C methylation were significantly elevated in the DR model. Knockdown of NSUN2 mitigated DR lesion formation both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, NSUN2 promoted MUC1 expression by binding to the RNA m<sup>5</sup>C reader ALYREF. Knockdown of ALYREF resulted in DR lesion alterations similar to those observed with NSUN2 knockdown. Moreover, MUC1 overexpression successfully reversed a series of DR alterations induced by NSUN2 silencing. NSUN2 regulates the expression of MUC1 through ALYREF-mediated RNA m<sup>5</sup>C methylation, thereby regulating the progression of DR and providing a new option for the treatment of DR in the future.\n",
            "ID: 38763955, Title: Effect of Akkermansia muciniphila on pancreatic islet β-cell function in rats with prediabetes mellitus induced by a high-fat diet., Abstract: Prediabetes is an important stage in the development of diabetes. It is necessary to find a safe, effective and sustainable way to delay and reverse the progression of prediabetes. Akkermansia muciniphila (A. muciniphila) is one of the key bacteria associated with glucose metabolism. Recent studies mainly focus on the effect of A. muciniphila on obesity and insulin resistance, but there is no research on the effect of A. muciniphila on pancreatic β-cell function and its mechanism in prediabetes. In this study, we investigated the effects of A. muciniphila on β-cell function, apoptosis and differentiation, as well as its effects on the gut microbiome, intestinal barrier, metaflammation and the expression of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in a high-fat diet (HFD)-induced prediabetic rat model. The effect of A. muciniphila was compared with dietary intervention. The results showed both A. muciniphila treatment and dietary intervention can reduce metaflammation by repairing the intestinal barrier in rats with prediabetes induced by an HFD and improve β-cell secretory function, apoptosis and differentiation through signaling pathways mediated by TLR2 and TLR4. Additionally, A. muciniphila can further elevate β-cell secretion, attenuate apoptosis and improve differentiation and the TLR signaling pathway on the basis of diet.\n",
            "ID: 38763922, Title: Assessment between antiseptic and normal saline for negative pressure wound therapy with instillation and dwell time in diabetic foot infections., Abstract: Negative pressure wound therapy with instillation and dwell time (NPWTi-d) is increasingly used for a diverse range of wounds. Meanwhile, the topical wound irrigation solution consisting of polyhexamethylene biguanide and betaine (PHMB-B) has shown efficacy in managing wound infections. However, the effectiveness of this solution as a topical instillation solution for NPWTi-d in patients with diabetic foot infections (DFIs) has not been thoroughly studied. The objective of this retrospective study was to evaluate the impact of using PHMB-B as the instillation solution during NPWTi-d on reducing bioburden and improving clinical outcomes in patients with DFIs. Between January 2017 and December 2022, a series of patients with DFIs received treatment with NPWTi-d, using either PHMB-B or normal saline as the instillation solution. Data collected retrospectively included demographic information, baseline wound characteristics, and treatment outcomes. The study included 61 patients in the PHMB-B group and 73 patients in the normal saline group, all diagnosed with DFIs. In comparison to patients treated with normal saline, patients with PHMB-B exhibited no significant differences in terms of wound bed preparation time (P = 0.5034), length of hospital stay (P = 0.6783), NPWTi-d application times (P = 0.1458), duration of systematic antimicrobial administration (P = 0.3567), or overall cost of hospitalization (P = 0.6713). The findings of the study suggest that the use of either PHMB-B or normal saline as an instillation solution in NPWTi-d for DFIs shows promise and effectiveness, yet no clinical distinction was observed between the two solutions.\n",

Their clinical and genetic features, treatment, and follow-up results were analyzed. <b>Results:</b> Among the 5 patients with MODY12 subtype, 4 were male and 1 was female, with an age of 13.4 (5.5, 14.6) years. Four of the patients were born large for gestational age, while one was born small for gestational age. Two patients were overweight or obese. Three patients exhibited typical symptoms of diabetes, while 2 were incidentally found to have elevated blood glucose level. One patient was found to have diabetic ketoacidosis at onset, who was diagnosed with congenital hyperinsulinism during the neonatal period and received diazoxide treatment, and experienced intellectual developmental delay. All 5 patients had autosomal dominant inherited diabetes within 3 generations. The fasting blood glucose at onset was 7.5 (6.5, 10.0) mmol/L, the haemoglobin, A1c (HbA1c) was 11.8% (7.5%, 13.5%), and the fasting C-peptide was 1.2 (1.1, 2.2)μg/L. The duration of follow-up was 15 (9, 32) months. One patient underwent lifestyle intervention, two received metformin orally, one received insulin therapy, and the other received subcutaneous injection of insulin combined with sulfonylurea orally. At the last follow-up, the median fasting blood glucose was 6.1 (5.1, 7.0) mmol/L, the HbA1c was 5.9% (5.7%, 7.1%), and the fasting C-peptide was 1.7 (0.9, 2.9)μg/L. One patient developed diabetic retinopathy. There were 4 missense variations in ABCC8 gene and one in-frame deletion, all of which were maternally inherited heterozygotes. <b>Conclusions:</b> MODY12 subtype is a heterogeneous disorder with the age of onset from infancy to adolescence. It can present as mild hyperglycemia or diabetic ketoacidosis, and has a high incidence of obesity. Definitive diagnosis can be achieved through genetic test, and individualized treatment is recommended based on glucose levels.\n",

Treatment with capecitabine and 5-fluorouracil induced severe hypertriglyceridemia repeatedly. Based on laboratory tests and clinical evaluations, treatment was suggested by specialists. After treatment with capecitabine, the patient's triglycerides increased from 19.7 mmol/L to 42 mmol/L. It was proposed that the patient had multifactorial chylomicronemia syndrome triggered by secondary factors. Statins, fenofibrate, ezetimib, and metformin were added to the therapy. After metastases appeared, FOLFIRI (leucovorin calcium [folinic acid], 5-fluorouracil, and irinotecan hydrochloride) chemotherapy and biological treatment (cetuximab) followed and triglycerides increased to 55.3 mmol/L. Monitoring triglyceride levels before and during therapy is suggested.\n",
            "ID: 38763677, Title: Anti-obesity and anti-diabetic bioactive peptides: A comprehensive review of their sources, properties, and techno-functional challenges., Abstract: The scourge of obesity arising from obesogens and poor dieting still ravages our planet as half of the global population may be overweight and obese by 2035. This metabolic disorder is intertwined with type 2 diabetes (T2D), both of which warrant alternative therapeutic options other than clinically approved drugs like orlistat with their tendency of abuse and side effects. In this review, we comprehensively describe the global obesity problem and its connection to T2D. Obesity, overconsumption of fats, the mechanism of fat digestion, obesogenic gut microbiota, inhibition of fat digestion, and natural anti-obesity compounds are discussed. Similar discussions are made for diabetes with regard to glucose regulation, the diabetic gut microbiota, and insulinotropic compounds. The sources and production of anti-obesity bioactive peptides (AOBPs) and anti-diabetic bioactive peptides (ADBPs) are also described while explaining their structure-function relationships, gastrointestinal behaviors, and action mechanisms. Finally, the techno-functional applications of AOBPs and ADBPs are highlighted.\n",
            "ID: 38763510, Title: Efficacy and Safety of Metformin and Atorvastatin Combination Therapy vs. Monotherapy with Either Drug in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Dyslipidemia Patients (ATOMIC): Double-Blinded Randomized Controlled Trial., Abstract: It is well known that a large number of patients with diabetes also have dyslipidemia, which significantly increases the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of combination drugs consisting of metformin and atorvastatin, widely used as therapeutic agents for diabetes and dyslipidemia. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group and phase III multicenter study included adults with glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels >7.0% and <10.0%, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) >100 and <250 mg/dL. One hundred eighty-five eligible subjects were randomized to the combination group (metformin+atorvastatin), metformin group (metformin+atorvastatin placebo), and atorvastatin group (atorvastatin+metformin placebo). The primary efficacy endpoints were the percent changes in HbA1c and LDL-C levels from baseline at the end of the treatment. After 16 weeks of treatment compared to baseline, HbA1c showed a significant difference of 0.94% compared to the atorvastatin group in the combination group (0.35% vs. -0.58%, respectively; P<0.0001), whereas the proportion of patients with increased HbA1c was also 62% and 15%, respectively, showing a significant difference (P<0.001). The combination group also showed a significant decrease in LDL-C levels compared to the metformin group (-55.20% vs. -7.69%, P<0.001) without previously unknown adverse drug events. The addition of atorvastatin to metformin improved HbA1c and LDL-C levels to a significant extent compared to metformin or atorvastatin alone in diabetes and dyslipidemia patients. This study also suggested metformin's preventive effect on the glucose-elevating potential of atorvastatin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and dyslipidemia, insufficiently controlled with exercise and diet. Metformin and atorvastatin combination might be an effective treatment in reducing the CVD risk in patients with both diabetes and dyslipidemia because of its lowering effect on LDL-C and glucose.\n",
            "ID: 38763496, Title: Effect of astaxanthin in type-2 diabetes -induced APPxhQC transgenic and NTG mice., Abstract: Aggregation and misfolding of amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau proteins, suggested to arise from post-translational modification processes, are thought to be the main cause of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Additionally, a plethora of evidence exists that links metabolic dysfunctions such as obesity, type 2 diabetes (T2D), and dyslipidemia to the pathogenesis of AD. We thus investigated the combinatory effect of T2D and human glutaminyl cyclase activity (pyroglutamylation), on the pathology of AD and whether astaxanthin (ASX) treatment ameliorates accompanying pathophysiological manifestations. Male transgenic AD mice, APPxhQC, expressing human APP751 with the Swedish and the London mutation and human glutaminyl cyclase (hQC) enzyme and their non-transgenic (NTG) littermates were used. Both APPxhQC and NTG mice were allocated to 3 groups, control, T2D-control, and T2D-ASX. Mice were fed control or high fat diet ± ASX for 13 weeks starting at an age of 11-12 months. High fat diet fed mice were further treated with streptozocin for T2D induction. Effects of genotype, T2D induction, and ASX treatment were evaluated by analysing glycemic readouts, lipid concentration, Aβ deposition, hippocampus-dependent cognitive function and nutrient sensing using immunosorbent assay, ELISA-based assays, western blotting, immunofluorescence staining, and behavioral testing via Morris water maze (MWM), respectively. APPxhQC mice presented a higher glucose sensitivity compared to NTG mice. T2D-induced brain dysfunction was more severe in NTG compared to the APPxhQC mice. T2D induction impaired memory functions while increasing hepatic LC3B, ABCA1, and p65 levels in NTG mice. T2D induction resulted in a progressive shift of Aβ from the soluble to insoluble form in APPxhQC mice. ASX treatment reversed T2D- induced memory dysfunction in NTG mice and in parallel increased hepatic pAKT while decreasing p65 and increasing cerebral p-S6rp and p65 levels. ASX treatment reduced soluble Aβ38 and Aβ40 and insoluble Aβ40 levels in T2D-induced APPxhQC mice. We demonstrate that T2D induction in APPxhQC mice poses additional risk for AD pathology as seen by increased Aβ deposition. Although ASX treatment reduced Aβ expression in T2D-induced APPxhQC mice and rescued T2D-induced memory impairment in NTG mice, ASX treatment alone may not be effective in cases of T2D comorbidity and AD.\n",
            "ID: 38763495, Title: A Novel Fatty Acid Mimetic with Pan-PPAR Partial Agonist Activity Inhibits Diet-Induced Obesity and Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease., Abstract: The prevalence of metabolic diseases is increasing globally at an alarming rate; thus, it is essential that effective, accessible, low-cost therapeutics are developed. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are transcription factors that tightly regulate glucose homeostasis and lipid metabolism and are important drug targets for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and dyslipidemia. We previously identified LDT409, a fatty acid-like compound derived from cashew nut shell liquid, as a novel pan-active PPARα/γ/δ compound. Herein, we aimed to assess the efficacy of LDT409 in vivo and investigate the molecular mechanisms governing the actions of the fatty acid mimetic LDT409 in diet-induced obese mice. C57Bl/6 mice (8-month-old) were fed a chow or high fat diet (HFD) for 4 weeks; mice thereafter received once daily intraperitoneal injections of vehicle, 10 mg/kg Rosiglitazone, 40 mg/kg WY14643, or 40 mg/kg LDT409 for 18 days while continuing the HFD. During treatments, body weight, food intake, glucose and insulin tolerance, energy expenditure, and intestinal lipid absorption were measured. On day 18 of treatment, tissues and plasma were collected for histological, molecular, and biochemical analysis. We found that treatment with LDT409 was effective at reversing HFD-induced obesity and associated metabolic abnormalities in mice. LDT409 lowered food intake and hyperlipidemia, while improving insulin tolerance. Despite being a substrate of both PPARα and PPARγ, LDT409 was crucial for promoting hepatic fatty acid oxidation and reducing hepatic steatosis in HFD-fed mice. We also highlighted a role for LDT409 in white and brown adipocytes in vitro and in vivo where it decreased fat accumulation, increased lipolysis, induced browning of WAT, and upregulated thermogenic gene Ucp1. Remarkably, LDT409 reversed HFD-induced weight gain back to chow-fed control levels. We determined that the LDT409-induced weight-loss was associated with a combination of increased energy expenditure (detectable before weight loss was apparent), decreased food intake, increased systemic fat utilization, and increased fecal lipid excretion in HFD-fed mice. Collectively, LDT409 represents a fatty acid mimetic that generates a uniquely favorable metabolic response for the treatment of multiple abnormalities including obesity, dyslipidemia, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, and diabetes. LDT409 is derived from a highly abundant natural product-based starting material and its development could be pursued as a therapeutic solution to the global metabolic health crisis.\n",

DM is among the major causes of deaths, and the limited efficacy of current treatments push the search for novel drug candidates, also among natural compounds. We focused our attention on caffeoylmalic acid, a phenolic derivative extracted from Urtica dioica, a plant investigated for its potential against type 2 DM. This compound was tested for its antidiabetic activity in vitro through a glucose uptake assay, in vivo in a mouse DM model and through molecular docking towards α-amylase and α-glucosidase. The effects on glucose blood level, liver enzymes, insulin and creatinine levels as well as on lipid and blood parameters, considered biochemical markers of diabetes, were also evaluated. The results showed an antidiabetic activity in vitro and in vivo, as the compound stimulates glucose absorbtion and reduces blood glucose levels. Moreover, it ameliorates lipid profile, liver and blood parameters, with moderate effect on insulin secretion. Taken together, these findings pave the way for the compounds from this class of caffeoylmalic acid as potential antidiabetic compounds.\n",
            "ID: 38763355, Title: β-hydroxybutyrate alleviates neurological deficits by restoring glymphatic and inflammation after subarachnoid hemorrhage in mice., Abstract: Both glymphatic system dysfunction and inflammatory response aggravate neurological dysfunction after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Studies have shown that β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) may mitigate painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN) by upregulating SNTA1 expression and reinstating AQP4 polarity. However, the potential of BHB to ameliorate glymphatic system function and inflammatory response in SAH mice remains uncertain. The SAH models were constructed by injection of arterial blood into cisterna Magana. Three groups of C57 mice were randomly assigned: Sham, SAH, and BHB. All mice were subjected to neurological function assessment, western blot, immunofluorescence double staining, and RNA-seq. Glymphatic system function was examined with tracer and immunofluorescence double staining, and the differential genes were examined with RNA-seq. In addition, the expression of related inflammation was detected. Compared with the SAH group, BHB reinstated AQP4 polarization by upregulating SNTA1 protein to enhance the glymphatic system. According to RNA-seq, the different genes were primarily connected to microglia activation, astrocytes, and inflammation. Western blot and immunofluorescence further confirmed that the related inflammatory protein expression levels were upregulated. BHB attenuated neuroinflammation after SAH. Ultimately, it can mitigate the neurological deficits in SAH mice. The study reveals a novel mechanism that BHB treatment mitigates neurologic impairment in SAH mice. We propose that BHB may play a neuroprotective effect by enhancing glymphatic system function and attenuating neuroinflammatory subarachnoid hemorrhage.\n",
            "ID: 38763181, Title: Recent advances in the effect of adipose tissue inflammation on insulin resistance., Abstract: Obesity is one of the major risk factors for diabetes. Excessive accumulation of fat leads to inflammation of adipose tissue, which can increase the risk of developing diabetes.. Obesity-related chronic inflammation can result in anomalies in glucose-lipid metabolism and insulin resistance, and it is a major cause of β-cell dysfunction in diabetes mellitus. Thus, a long-term tissue inflammatory response is crucial for metabolic diseases, particularly type 2 diabetes. Chronic inflammation associated with obesity increases oxidative stress, secretes inflammatory factors, modifies endocrine variables, and interferes with insulin signalling pathways, all of which contribute to insulin resistance and glucose tolerance. Insulin resistance and diabetes are ultimately caused by chronic inflammation in the stomach, pancreas, liver, muscle, and fat tissues. In this article, we systematically summarize the latest research progress on the mechanisms of adipose tissue inflammation and insulin resistance, as well as the mechanisms of cross-talk between adipose tissue inflammation and insulin resistance, with a view to providing some meaningful therapeutic strategies for the treatment of insulin resistance by controlling adipose tissue inflammation.\n",

In total, 461 children were recruited from an online community (i.e., a Wechat group) of pediatric patients with T1DM. A self-developed questionnaire was filled in by parents, collecting the information on social demographics, disease, and insulin pump therapy related characteristics and skin problems. We applied the Mann-Whitney U test, Chi square test and logistic regression analysis to identify the factors associated with skin problems. Of the 461 responders, 308 (66.8 %) children were reported to have skin problems. More specifically, 38.8 % had pigmentation changes, 22.3 % allergy/dermatitis, 20.2 % scaring, 11.5 % pain, 10.8 % infection, 10.6 % subcutaneous lipohypertrophy, and 6.1 % lipoatrophy. Logistic regression analysis showed that independent associated factors of skin problems were the caregiver's educational level as college or above, patient having skin allergies, and using the Brand 2 insulin pump (p values < 0.05). The present study documents the prevalence of skin problems and identifies associated factors, such as caregiver's education, patients skin allergies, and using a specific brand of pump. Health education should address these factors in addition to the traditionally emphasized factors.\n",

            "ID: 38769011, Title: Evaluation of systemic medications associated with diabetic retinopathy: a nested case-control study from the UK Biobank., Abstract: This study aims to investigate the associations between commonly used systemic medications and diabetic retinopathy (DR). Individuals with linked primary care prescription data from the UK Biobank were included. Cases were defined as individuals with a Hospital Episode Statistics-coded or primary care recorded diagnosis of DR or self-reported DR. Controls were matched for age, sex, glycosylated haemoglobin, duration of diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension status and cardiovascular disease status. ORs and 95% CIs were calculated using conditional univariate and multivariable logistic regression models. A total of 3377 case subjects with DR were included in the study and matched with 3377 control subjects. In multivariable logistic regression, increased odds of incident DR were observed for exposure to short-acting insulins (OR 1.63; 95% CI 1.22 to 2.18), medium-acting insulins (OR 2.10; 95% CI 1.60 to 2.75), sulfonylureas (OR 1.30; 95% CI 1.16 to 1.46). Instead, the use of fibrates (OR 0.71; 95% CI 0.53 to 0.94) and Cox-2 inhibitors (OR 0.68; 95% CI 0.58 to 0.79) was associated with decreased odds of incident DR. Dose-response relationships were observed for all five drug categories (all p<0.05). This study comprehensively investigated the associations between systemic medication use and DR and found significant associations between the use of short-acting insulins, medium-acting insulins and sulfonylureas with increased odds of incident DR. In contrast, fibrates and Cox-2 inhibitors were associated with decreased odds of incident DR. These findings may provide valuable insights into DM medication management and serve as a reference for the prevention of DR in patients with DM.\n",
            "ID: 38768904, Title: Postpartum Blood Pressure Control and the Rate of Readmission., Abstract: Postpartum hypertension is a major contributor to the rising maternal mortality rates in the United States with nearly half of maternal deaths occurring after delivery. Previous studies have found evidence that the maximum blood pressure reading during the labor and delivery admission can predict readmission, however the optimal blood pressure to reduce the need for readmissions and additional medical treatment in the postpartum period is not known. To investigate the relationship between postpartum blood pressure control at discharge and readmission within the first six weeks after delivery. Data were obtained from Cosmos, an EHR-based, HIPAA-defined limited data set that includes more than 1.4 million birth encounters. All birthing parents with blood pressure data after delivery were included. Demographic information, medications, and readmissions were queried from the dataset. Patients were grouped into categories based on blood pressure readings in the 24 hours prior to discharge (≥160/110, ≥150/100, ≥140/90, ≥130/80, ≥120/80, and <120/80). The readmission rates across these groups were compared. Planned sub-analyses included stratification by the use of antihypertensive medications and a sensitivity analysis using the highest blood pressure during admission. Covariates included maternal age, pre-existing diabetes or lupus, and BMI. The analysis included 1,265,766 total birth encounters, 30.9% in the referent group, 120/80, 31.0% in <120/80, 19.7% in ≥130/80, 1.3% in ≥140/90, 4.0% in ≥150/100, and 1.6% in ≥160/110 groups. In the first six weeks after delivery, readmission rates rose with higher blood pressure readings. More than 5% of postpartum patients with the highest blood pressure readings (≥160/110) were readmitted. They were almost three times more likely to be readmitted than patients whose highest blood pressure reading fell into the referent group (120/80) (OR 2.90 [95%CI 2.69-3.12]). Patients with blood pressures >150/100 (2.72 [2.58-2.87]), >140/90 (2.03 [1.95-2.11]), and >130/80 (1.43 [1.37-1.49]) all had higher odds of readmission while those all <120/80 had a lower risk (0.78 [0.75-0.81]). Patients who had higher blood pressures during the admission but had improved control in the 24 hours prior to discharge had lower rates of readmission than those whose blood pressures remained elevated. At all blood pressure categories, patients who received an antihypertensive prescription had higher rates of readmission. In this large, national dataset, blood pressure control at discharge and readmission in the postpartum period were significantly correlated. These data should inform postpartum hypertension treatment goals and the role of remote monitoring programs to improve maternal safety.\n",
            "ID: 38768871, Title: Pomegranate (Punica granatum L.) phytochemicals target the components of metabolic syndrome., Abstract: Pomegranate (Punica granatum L.) is a multipurpose dietary and medicinal plant known for its ability to promote various health benefits. Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a complex metabolic disorder driving health and socioeconomic challenges worldwide. It may be characterized by insulin resistance, abdominal obesity, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. This study aims to conduct a review of pomegranate's effects on MetS parameters using a mechanistic approach relying on pre-clinical studies. The peel, juice, roots, bark, seeds, flowers, and leaves of the fruit present several bioactive compounds that are related mainly to anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities as well as cardioprotective, antidiabetic, and antiobesity effects. The use of the juice extract can work as a potent inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme activities, consequently regulating blood pressure. The major bioactive compounds found within the fruit are phenolic compounds (hydrolysable tannins and flavonoids) and fatty acids. Alkaloids, punicalagin, ellagitannins, ellagic acid, anthocyanins, tannins, flavonoids, luteolin, and punicic acid are also present. The antihyperglycemia, antihyperlipidemia, and weight loss promoting effects are likely related to the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. When considering clinical application, pomegranate extracts are found to be frequently well-tolerated, further supporting its efficacy as a treatment modality. We suggest that pomegranate fruit, extract, or processed products can be used to counteract MetS-related risk factors. This review represents an important step towards exploring potential avenues for further research in this area.\n",
            "ID: 38768867, Title: Association of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor use with risk of osteoporotic fracture among older women: A nationwide, population-based cohort study., Abstract: We investigated the relationship between sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) and fracture in elderly women diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and newly prescribed antidiabetic medications (ADMs). We used the population-based cohort study data from the National Health Insurance Service of Korea (2013-2020). Women ≥65 years old with T2DM, who were newly prescribed ADMs other than glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and thiazolidinedione, and who had comprehensive health check-up data were included. A total of 1,333 SGLT2i users were matched in a 1:2 ratio with 2,626 non-SGLT2i users. After propensity score matching, mean age, body mass index, number of ADMs, and other covariates were well-balanced between SGLT2i users and non-SGLT2i users. During the follow-up period, a higher incidence of vertebral fractures in SGLT2i users than in non-SGLT2i users (incidence rate 19.2 vs. 13.8 per 1,000 person-years; hazard ratio 1.40, 95 % confidence interval 1.00-1.96, p = 0.049). No significant difference was noted in other types of fracture. SGLT2i use showed an increased risk of vertebral fracture than non-SGLT2i use in elderly women. Although further validation is required, SGLT2i should be cautiously prescribed in older women due to the potential association with fracture risk.\n",
            "ID: 38768866, Title: The effects of policosanol supplementation on blood glucose: A systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials., Abstract: Previous studies have assessed how supplementing with policosanol affects blood sugar levels. The outcomes, nevertheless, were not constant. Multiple electronic databases were searched including ISI Web of Science, Cochrane Library, PubMed, Google Scholar, and Scopus until February 9, 2023. To assess the effects of policosanol on glucose, we employed a random-effects or fixed-effects meta-analysis approach to examine the weighted mean differences (WMDs) and associated 95 % confidence intervals (CI) before and after policosanol and placebo administration. The final analysis comprised a total of 25 trials with 2680 participants. Compared to the control group, policosanol supplementation significantly reduced blood glucose levels (WMD: -2.24 mg/dl; 95 % CI: -4.05, -0.42, P = 0.01). Findings from subgroup analysis revealed a significant reduction of policosanol supplementation on glucose levels in period of less than 24 weeks, and in individuals below 50 years of age. Additionally, the reduction was statistically significant in dosage of 10 mg/day. Our dose-response analysis indicates no evidence of a non-linear relationship between policosanol dose and duration and changes in glucose levels (P-nonlinearity = 0.52, and P-nonlinearity = 0.52, respectively). Policosanol supplementation might improve blood glucose. Further trials with more complex designs are required to confirm the findings.\n",
            "ID: 38768849, Title: Progressive supranuclear palsy, a case report., Abstract: Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP), also known as Steele-Richardson-Olszewski syndrome, is a rare neurodegenerative disease characterized by a variety of motor and neuro-ophthalmological symptoms. We present the case of a 73-year-old male patient with a history of type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure, who consulted for gait disorders, tremors in the extremities, and difficulty controlling conjugate gaze. During physical examination, findings consistent with PSP were noted, including hypomimia, muscle rigidity, and abnormal movements. The initial misdiagnosis of Parkinson's disease and subsequent administration of levodopa highlight the importance of accurate diagnosis in complex neurological conditions. This clinical case highlights the need for a thorough evaluation of neuro-ophthalmological symptoms and signs to ensure an appropriate therapeutic approach and improve the quality of life of patients.\n",
            "ID: 38768826, Title: Associations of meeting 24-hour movement behavior guidelines with social and emotional function in youth with ASD/ADHD., Abstract: The 24-hour movement behavior (24-HMB) guidelines recommend that children and adolescents should limit screen time (ST), get an adequate amount of sleep (SL), and engage in sufficient physical activity (PA) to ensure health and healthy development. Meeting 24-HMB guidelines is associated with positive mental health outcomes (e.g., social and emotional function) in the general population. However, it is unclear whether such findings extend to children and adolescents with comorbid Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Thus, we examined associations of meeting 24-HMB guidelines with social and emotional function in children and adolescents with comorbid ASD/ADHD. Data from the 2020-2021 National Survey of Children's Health - a U.S. national, population-based, cross-sectional study - were used. We extracted and analyzed data on children and adolescents (aged between 6 and 17 years) diagnosed with comorbidity of ASD/ADHD. Data on movement behaviors (PA, ST, and SL) and specific outcome variables (social function and emotional function) were collected through caregiver-proxy reports. Logistic regressions were performed to examine the associations between meeting 24-HMB guidelines and social and emotional outcomes adjusting for covariates (e.g., age, sex, ethnicity, weight status, birth status, socio-economic status, and receiving medication/behavioral treatment). Among 979 children and adolescents with comorbid ASD/ADHD, only 3.8 % met all three 24-HMB guidelines. In total, 45.0 % of participants met at least one guideline, and 25.5 % of those met at least two guidelines. Compared to those who did not meet any 24-HMB guidelines, meeting SL + ST guidelines was significantly associated with lower odds of poorer social function (being bullied: OR = 0.3, 95%CI [0.1-0.7]; arguing: OR = 0.2, 95%CI[0.1-0.4]). Furthermore, meeting PA + ST + SL guidelines was associated with lower odds of poorer emotional function (depression: OR = 0.5, 95%CI[0.3-0.7]). Meeting 24-HMB guidelines was associated with better social and emotional function in U.S. children and adolescents with comorbid ASD/ADHD; however, currently very few with comorbid ASD/ADHD meet all 24-HMB guidelines. These results emphasize the importance of promoting adherence to the 24-HMB guidelines among children and adolescents facing the challenges of comorbid ASD/ADHD. These cross-sectional findings point to the need for further empirical evidence from longitudinal studies to support our conclusions.\n",
            "ID: 38768824, Title: Exploring the L-shaped relationship between Atherogenic Index of Plasma and depression: Results from NHANES 2005-2018., Abstract: The Atherogenic Index of Plasma (AIP) is a novel metric linked to several diseases. However, there is inadequate evidence to investigate the relationship between AIP and depression. Therefore, we aim to elucidate the non-linear association between AIP and depression. 12,453 participants from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2005-2018 were included. The AIP was calculated as log10 (triglycerides/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol). The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) was used to identify depression (PHQ-9 ≥ 10). Weighted multivariate logistic regression, restricted cubic splines (RCS) models, subgroup analysis, and interaction tests were employed to reveal the relationship between AIP and depression. AIP was found to be significantly correlated with depression. In the fully adjusted model, elevated AIP levels were associated with higher odds of depression (odds ratio [OR] = 1.50; 95 % CI: 1.06-2.12). The RCS analysis indicated an L-shaped pattern in the relationship between depression and AIP, with inflection points at -0.289. Beyond this inflection point, individuals with elevated AIP levels were associated with higher odds of depression (OR = 2.25; 95 % CI: 1.49-3.39). Notably, the association was particularly pronounced among individuals with diabetes. This cross-sectional study is unable to establish causal relationships. There was an L-shaped association between AIP and depression among US adults. AIP has the potential value as a biological marker for depression, and maintaining AIP values below a certain threshold may help in managing depression.\n",

This study intended to evaluate the associations of dietary flavonoids intake and depressive symptoms in diabetic patients in American adults. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of 1993 adults aged ≥20 years old who participated in the 2007-2008, 2009-2010, and 2017-2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES). Chi-square test and independent-sample t-test were used to compare subjects' characteristics. Logistic regression model was further used to analyze the relationship between dietary flavonoid intake and depressive symptoms in diabetic patients. Restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis was used to investigate the non-linear relationship between dietary flavonoid intake and the prevalence of depressive symptoms in diabetic patients. The weighted quartile sum (WQS) regression was used to analyze the effect of 29 flavonoids monomers. The results showed that the total flavonoid intake in the third quartile (OR, 0.635; 95 % CI,0.419-0.962; P, 0.032) was significantly associated with a reduced risk of depressive symptoms in diabetic patients compared with the lowest quartile. And there was a U-shaped association between dietary flavonoid intake and risk of depressive symptoms in diabetic patients. Top contributors of flavonoid monomers were eriodictyol, naringenin, and theaflavin-3'-gallate, accounting for a percentage of 30.83 %, 22.17 %, and 6.92 %, respectively. Moderate (56.07-207.12 mg/day) dietary flavonoid intake was associated with a reduced risk of depressive symptoms in diabetic patients. The important flavonoid monomers were eriodictyol, naringenin, and theaflavin-3'-gallate.\n",
            "ID: 38768802, Title: A site-specific phosphorylation in FSTL1 determines its promigratory role in wound healing., Abstract: Follistatin like-1 (FSTL-1) is a secreted glycoprotein of mesenchymal in origin. In human skin, FSTL1 is upregulated in the epidermal keratinocytes upon acute injury and is required for the migration of keratinocytes. Failure to upregulate FSTL1 leads to the lack of keratinocyte migration and the non- healing nature of diabetic foot ulcer (DFU). FSTL1 undergoes extensive post-translational modification (PTM) at specific residues. Glycosylation at N144, N175 and N180, are the only experimentally demonstrated PTM in FSTL1, wherein, N180 and N144 glycosylations have been found to be critical for its function in cardiac tissue regeneration and pre-adipocyte differentiation, respectively. However, it is not known if PTMs other than glycosylation occurs in FSTL1 and how it impacts its pro-migratory function. Using in-silico analysis of mass spectrometric datasets, we found a novel PTM, namely, Serine 165 (S165) phosphorylation in FSTL1. To address the role of S165 phosphorylation in its pro-migratory function, a phosphorylation defective mutant of FSTL1 (S165A) was constructed by converting serine 165 to alanine and over expressed in 293T cells. S165A mutation did not affect the secretion of FSTL1 in vitro. However, S165A abolished the pro-migratory effect of FSTL1 in cultured keratinocytes likely via its inability to facilitate ERK signaling pathway. Interestingly, bacterially expressed recombinant FSTL1, trans-dominantly inhibited wound closure in keratinocytes highlighting the prime role of FSTL1 phosphorylation for its pro-migratory function. Further, under high glucose conditions, which inhibited scratchwound migration of keratinocytes, we noticed a significant decrease in S165 phosphorylation. Taken together, our results reveal a hitherto unreported role of FSTL1 phosphorylation PTM with profound implications in wound healing.\n",

This review aims to appraise the phytochemistry, ethnopharmacology, and pharmacological activities of Rydingia species growing in Iran and assess their potential in clinical applications. Besides, it critically evaluates existing literature and looks into the perspective for further research and utilization. All available scientific literature was consulted using the database searches involving Google Scholar, PubMed, and Web of Science applying the keyword Rydingia and its Syn; Otostegia. Only the search results that are associated with the Iranian species R. michauxii and R. persica are included in this review. α-pinene, carvacrol, caryophyllene oxide, diisooctyl phthalate, dillapiole, eugenol, hexadecanoic acid, and pentacosane are the major constituents of the essential oils of the Rydingia species. Additionally, these species produce bioactive flavonoids, phenolic acids, steroids, and terpenoids. Extracts and active compounds from Rydingia species have been reported to possess various pharmacological activities including antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory, antimalarial, antimicrobial, antioxidant, cytotoxic, and lipid-lowering properties. Based on the information available to date on the Iranian Rydingia species, it will be worth subjecting these species to further developmental work involving preclinical and clinical trials.\n",
            "ID: 38768690, Title: The integrated stress response in pancreatic development, tissue homeostasis, and cancer., Abstract: Present in all eukaryotic cells, the integrated stress response (ISR) is a highly coordinated signaling network that controls cellular behavior, metabolism and survival in response to diverse stresses. The ISR is initiated when any one of four stress sensing kinases (PERK, GCN2, PKR, HRI) becomes activated to phosphorylate the protein translation initiation factor eIF2α, shifting gene expression toward a comprehensive rewiring of cellular machinery to promote adaptation. While the ISR has been shown to play an important role in the homeostasis of multiple tissues, evidence suggests that it is particularly crucial for the development and ongoing health of the pancreas. Among the most synthetically dynamic tissues in the body, the exocrine and endocrine pancreas relies heavily on the ISR to rapidly adjust cell function to meet the metabolic demands of the organism. The hardwiring of the ISR into normal pancreatic functions and adaptation to stress may explain why it is a commonly utilized pro-oncogenic and therapy-resistance mechanism in both pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PanNETs). Here we review what is known about the key roles that the ISR plays in the development, homeostasis, and neoplasia of the pancreas.\n",
            "ID: 38768659, Title: Cost-Effectiveness of Diabetic Retinopathy Screening for Newly Diagnosed Type 2 Diabetic Patients: A Nationwide Population-based Propensity Score-Matched Cohort Study., Abstract: This study investigated the association between the frequency of screening for diabetic retinopathy (DR) versus the development of DR and corresponding medical expenses among patients newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This longitudinal, population-based study used the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database (2004 to 2020) as a data source. Propensity score matching (PSM) (sex, age, comorbidities and concurrent medication use) was employed in the grouping of T2DM patients according to different frequency of DR screening. Outcome measures included the proportion of patients who developed DR, who received DR treatment, and the associated medical expenses and hospitalizations. The 17-year cohort included 337,046 patients. After PSM, three groups each containing 35,739 patients were assembled and analyzed. Compared to low-frequency screening, high-frequency screening was more effective in detecting patients requiring treatment; however, the net cost for treatment was significantly lower. Standard-frequency screening appears to provide the best balance in terms of DR detection, diagnosis interval, the risk of DR-related hospitalization, and DR treatment costs. In this real-world cohort study covering all levels of the healthcare system, infrequent screening was associated with delayed diagnosis and elevated treatment costs, while a fundus screening interval of 1-2 years proved optimal in terms of detection and medical expenditures.\n",

Individual trials were powered to study composite outcomes in one disease state. We aimed to evaluate the treatment effect of SGLT2 inhibitors on specific clinical endpoints across multiple demographic and disease subgroups. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we queried online databases (PubMed, Cochrane CENTRAL, and SCOPUS) up to Feb 10, 2024, for primary and secondary analyses of large trials (n>1000) of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with heart failure, type 2 diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (including acute myocardial infarction). Outcomes studied included composite of first hospitalisation for heart failure or cardiovascular death, first hospitalisation for heart failure, cardiovascular death, total (first and recurrent) hospitalisation for heart failure, and all-cause mortality. Effect sizes were pooled using random-effects models. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42024513836. We included 15 trials (N=100 952). Compared with placebo, SGLT2 inhibitors reduced the risk of first hospitalisation for heart failure by 29% in patients with heart failure (hazard ratio [HR] 0·71 [95% CI 0·67-0·77]), 28% in patients with type 2 diabetes (0·72 [0·67-0·77]), 32% in patients with chronic kidney disease (0·68 [0·61-0·77]), and 28% in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (0·72 [0·66-0·79]). SGLT2 inhibitors reduced cardiovascular death by 14% in patients with heart failure (HR 0·86 [95% CI 0·79-0·93]), 15% in patients with type 2 diabetes (0·85 [0·79-0·91]), 11% in patients with chronic kidney disease (0·89 [0·82-0·96]), and 13% in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (0·87 [0·78-0·97]). The benefit of SGLT2 inhibitors on both first hospitalisation for heart failure and cardiovascular death was consistent across the majority of the 51 subgroups studied. Notable exceptions included acute myocardial infarction (22% reduction in first hospitalisation for heart failure; no effect on cardiovascular death) and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (26% reduction in first hospitalisation for heart failure; no effect on cardiovascular death). SGLT2 inhibitors reduced heart failure events and cardiovascular death in patients with heart failure, type 2 diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. These effects were consistent across a wide range of subgroups within these populations. This supports the eligibility of a large population with cardiorenal-metabolic diseases for treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors. None.\n",

            "ID: 38768613, Title: Nutritional Challenges and Treatment After Bariatric Surgery., Abstract: Bariatric surgery is an important weight loss tool in individuals with severe obesity. It is currently the most effective long-term weight loss treatment that lowers obesity-related comorbidities. It also has significant physiological and nutritional consequences that can result in gastrointestinal complications and micronutrient deficiencies. After gastric bypass, common clinical events that negatively affect nutritional status include malabsorption, dumping syndrome, kidney stones, altered intestinal bile acid availability, bowel obstruction, ulcer, gastroesophageal reflux, and bacterial overgrowth. Risk factors for poor nutritional status and excessive loss of lean body mass and bone include reduced dietary quality and inadequate intake, altered nutrient absorption, and poor patient compliance with nutrient supplementation. There are unique concerns in adolescents, older individuals, and individuals who become pregnant postoperatively. With careful management, health-care professionals can assist with long-term weight loss success and minimize the risk of acute and long-term nutrition complications after bariatric surgery.\n",

Recognizing the urgent need for effective solutions, it is crucial to develop suitable scaffolds specifically tailored for diabetic wound healing. In line with this objective, we have developed novel hybrid nanofibrous scaffolds by combining polyvinyl alcohol/chitosan (PVA/CS) and gelatin/poly(Ɛ-caprolactone) (Gel/PCL) polymers through a double-nozzle electrospinning technique. In this study, we investigated the influence of the Gel/PCL blend ratio on the properties of the resulting nanofibers. Three different hybrid scaffold structures were examined: Gel/PCL (80:20)-PVA/CS (80:20), Gel/PCL (50:50)-PVA/CS (80:20), and Gel/PVA (20:80)-PVA/CS (80:20). Our findings demonstrate that the electrospun nanofibers of PVA/CS (80:20)-Gel/PCL (80:20) exhibited optimal mechanical performance, with a contact angle of approximately 54° and a diameter of 183 nm. Considering the crucial role of inhibiting bacterial adhesion in the success of implanted materials, we evaluated the cytocompatibility of the hybrid electrospun nanofibers using mouse fibroblast cells (L-929 cells). The in vitro cytotoxicity results obtained from L-929 fibroblast cell culture on the hybrid scaffolds revealed enhanced cell proliferation and appropriate cell morphology on the PVA/CS (80:20)-Gel/PCL (80:20) sample, indicating its capability to support tissue cell integration. Based on the information obtained from this study, the fabricated hybrid scaffold holds great promise for diabetic ulcer healing. Its optimal mechanical properties, suitable contact angle, and favorable cytocompatibility highlight its potential as a valuable tool in the field of diabetic wound healing. The development of such hybrid scaffolds represents a significant step forward in addressing the challenges associated with diabetic wound care.&#xD.\n",

We investigated the prevalence of placental HPV at delivery, explored urine HPV characteristics associated with placental HPV and whether placental HPV increased the risk adverse pregnancy outcomes. Pregnant women were enrolled in the Scandinavian PreventADALL mother-child cohort study at midgestation. Human papillomavirus genotyping was performed on placental biopsies collected at delivery (n = 587) and first-void urine at midgestation and delivery (n = 556). Maternal characteristics were collected by questionnaires at gestational week 18 and 34. Adverse pregnancy outcomes were registered from chart data including hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, gestational diabetes mellitus and newborns small for gestational age. Uni- and multivariable regression models were used to investigate associations. Placental HPV was detected in 18/587 (3 %). Twenty-eight genotypes were identified among the 214/556 (38 %) with midgestational urine HPV. Seventeen of the 18 women with placental HPV were midgestational HPV positive with 89 % genotype concordance. Midgestational high-risk-(HR)-HPV and high viral loads of Any- or HR-HPV were associated with placental HPV. Persisting HPV infection from midgestation to delivery was not associated with placental HPV. Adverse pregnancy outcomes were seen in 2/556 (0.4 %) of women with placental HPV. In this general cohort of pregnant women, the prevalence of placental HPV was 3 %, and midgestational urinary HPV 38 %. High HPV viral load increased the risk for placental HPV infections. We observed no increased risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with placental HPV.\n",

In recent years, with the increasing incidence of DM, the pathogenesis of DKD has received increasing attention. The pathogenesis of DKD is diverse and complex. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) contain cell-derived membrane proteins, nucleic acids (such as DNA and RNA) and other important cellular components and are involved in intercellular information and substance transmission. In recent years, an increasing number of studies have confirmed that EVs play an important role in the development of DKD. The purpose of this paper is to explain the potential diagnostic value of EVs in DKD, analyze the mechanism by which EVs participate in intercellular communication, and explore whether EVs may become drug carriers for targeted therapy to provide a reference for promoting the implementation and application of exosome therapy strategies in clinical practice.\n",
            "ID: 38769592, Title: Long-term renal and cardiovascular risks of tacrolimus in patients with lupus nephritis., Abstract: Despite continuous advancement, treatment of lupus nephritis (LN) remains challenging. Recent guidelines now include a regimen incorporating tacrolimus as a first-line treatment option. Even though tacrolimus is effective in combination with mycophenolate and corticosteroids, concerns remain regarding long-term use, given its association with increased cardiovascular risks including nephrotoxicity, hypertension, dyslipidemia and hyperglycemia in kidney transplant recipients. However, in LN, long-term evaluations and head-to-head comparisons are lacking and thus the safety profile remains ill-defined. We hypothesized that chronic toxicity also occurs in LN patients. Therefore, this study aimed to assess long-term cardiovascular and renal outcomes of tacrolimus in LN patients. This observational cohort study examined adult LN patients treated with tacrolimus, assessing renal outcomes, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, cardiovascular events and the Framingham risk score. The results were compared to a control group of CNI-naïve LN patients. Of the 219 LN patients in this study, 43 (19.6%) had tacrolimus exposure. Over a median follow-up of 7.1 years, tacrolimus use was associated with significant kidney function decline (6.8 ml/min/1.73m2, versus 0.8 in the control group). The incidence of end-stage kidney disease was similar. Cardiovascular event incidence was equally low in both groups. The 10-year risk of coronary heart disease was lower in the tacrolimus group, primarily due to age differences. HbA1c levels were higher in the tacrolimus group (37.4 mmol/mol) than in controls (33.6 mmol/mol), although the incidence of diabetes was similar. There were no differences in the occurrence of hypertension or dyslipidemia. Our study demonstrated that tacrolimus exposure was associated with long-term kidney function loss in LN patients. Although cardiovascular risk factors and events were similar to patients never exposed to tacrolimus, there may be an increased risk of developing diabetes. Therefore, our study supports vigilance towards renal adverse effects in LN patients treated with tacrolimus.\n",

An executive committee of experts was created, comprised by a panel of fifteen physicians, including endocrinologists and internal medicine physicians, with expertise in management of adult patients with T2DM. The experts were from various countries: Colombia, Chile, Peru, Mexico, Argentina, and Brazil. The modified Delphi method was used, considering a consensus level of at least 80% of the participants. A seventeen-item instrument was developed to establish recommendations on the use of fCGM in patients with T2DM in Latin American. The number of glucose scans recommended per day with the fCGM for patients managed with oral antidiabetic drugs or basal insulin was a median of 6 scans per day, and for those managed with multiple insulin doses, a median of 10 scans per day was recommended. Additionally, a holistic and individualized management approach was recommended, taking into account new treatment directions and identifying patients who would benefit from the use of the fCGM. Continuous use of the fCGM is recommended for people living with T2DM, regardless of their type of treatment. These metrics must be evaluated individually for each patient profile.\n",

An 83-year-old healthy woman, who had received her fourth COVID-19 vaccine dose 2 days before admission, presented to the emergency department with difficulty moving. On examination, impaired consciousness (Glasgow Coma Scale: 14) and fever were observed. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of the head revealed swelling from the sella turcica to the suprasellar region. Her morning serum cortisol level was low (4.4 μg/dL) and adrenocorticotropic hormone level was normal (21.6 pg/mL). Central hypothyroidism was also suspected (thyroid stimulating hormone, 0.46 μIU/mL; free triiodothyronine, 1.86 pg/mL; free thyroxine, 0.48 ng/dL). Secondary adrenocortical insufficiency, growth hormone deficiency, delayed gonadotropin response, and elevated prolactin levels were also observed. After administration of prednisolone and levothyroxine, her consciousness recovered. On the 7th day of admission, the patient developed polyuria, and arginine vasopressin deficiency was diagnosed using a hypertonic saline test. On the 15th day, the posterior pituitary gland showed a loss of high signal intensity and the polyuria resolved spontaneously. On the 134th day, the corticotropin-releasing hormone loading test showed a normal response; however, the thyrotropin-releasing hormone stimulation test showed a low response. The patient's disease course was stable with continued thyroid and adrenal corticosteroid supplementation. Herein, we report a rare case of anterior hypopituitarism and arginine vasopressin deficiency secondary to hypophysitis following COVID-19 vaccination.\n",

We aimed to assess the effect of prediabetes in patients with chronic coronary syndrome on clinical outcomes. This is a secondary analysis of data from the ISCHEMIA and ISCHEMIA-CKD trials, including patients with chronic coronary syndrome determined by coronary computed tomography angiography or exercise-stress testing. Participants were assigned to the normoglycemia group (HbA1c < 5.7% [< 39 mmol/mol]), prediabetes group (HbA1c 5.7-6.4% [40-47 mmol/mol]), or diabetes group (HbA1c ≥ 6.5% [≥ 48 mmol/mol]). The primary end point of this study was all-cause mortality. Secondary endpoints included major adverse cardiovascular events and composites thereof. Overall, the primary endpoint all-cause mortality occurred in 330 (8.4%) of 3910 patients over a median follow-up time of 3.1 years (IQR 2.1-4.1). The primary endpoint all-cause mortality occurred in 37 (5.2%) of 716 patients in the normoglycemia group, in 63 (6.9%) of 911 in the prediabetes group, and in 230 (10.1%) of 2283 in the diabetes group. In the covariate-adjusted Cox model analysis, the estimated adjusted HR (aHR) in the prediabetes group as compared with the normoglycemia group was 1.45 (95%CI, 0.95-2.20). The aHR in the diabetes group as compared with the normoglycemia group was 1.84 (95%CI, 1.29-2.65). Prediabetes, compared with normoglycemia, was associated with an increased risk of stroke (aHR, 3.44, 95%CI, 1.15-10.25). Subgroup analyses suggested an increased risk of all-cause death associated with prediabetes in males and patients under 65 years. In patients with chronic coronary syndrome, diabetes but not prediabetes was associated with significantly increased risk of all-cause death within a median follow-up period of 3.1 years.

Deprived populations are particularly affected by diabetes and are less likely to have access to these programmes. DSM implementation in primary care, particularly in a multi-professional primary care practice (MPCP), is a valuable strategy to promote care access for these populations. In Rennes (Western France), a DSM programme was designed by a MPCP in a socio-economically deprived area. The study objective was to compare diabetes control in people who followed or not this DSM programme. The historical cohort of patients who participated in the DSM programme at the MPCP between 2017 and 2019 (n = 69) was compared with patients who did not participate in the programme, matched on sex, age, diabetes type and place of the general practitioner's practice (n = 138). The primary outcome was glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) change between 12 months before and 12 months after the DSM programme. Secondary outcomes included modifications in diabetes treatment, body mass index, blood pressure, dyslipidaemia, presence of microalbuminuria, and diabetes retinopathy screening participation. HbA1c was significantly improved in the exposed group after the programme (p < 0.01). The analysis did not find any significant between-group difference in socio-demographic data, medical history, comorbidities, and treatment adaptation. These results, consistent with the international literature, promote the development of DSM programmes in primary care settings in deprived areas. The results of this real-life study need to be confirmed on the long-term and in different contexts (rural area, healthcare organisation).\n",

However, tubing blockages during HIPEC treatment pose a common challenge, impeding the smooth progression of therapy. Few studies to date have explored the incidence and risk factors of tube occlusion during HIPEC in patients with appendiceal PMP, as well as its adverse impact on postoperative complications. From October 2017 to June 2023, a total of 80 patients with appendiceal PMP undergoing combined CRS and HIPEC were included in this study. Tubing blockage events were strictly defined, with patients experiencing blockages during HIPEC treatment allocated to the study group, while those with unobstructed perfusion were assigned to the control group. A comparative analysis was conducted between the two groups regarding post-HIPEC health assessments and occurrence of complications. Risk factors for luminal occlusion during closed HIPEC procedures were identified through univariate and multivariate analysis of data from 303 HIPEC treatments. Tubing blockages occurred in 41 patients (51.3%). The study group experienced prolonged gastrointestinal decompression time (4.1 ± 3.0 vs. 2.5 ± 1.7 days, P = 0.003) and prolonged time to bowel movement (6.1 ± 2.3 vs. 5.1 ± 1.8 days, P = 0.022) compared to the control group. There was no significant difference in the incidence of complications between the two groups. The 1-year survival rate postoperatively was 97%, and the 3-year survival rate was 81%, with no association found between tubing blockage and poorer survival. Additionally, In 303 instances of HIPEC treatment among these 80 patients, tube occlusion occurred in 89 cases (89/303, 29.4%). Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed age, diabetes, hypertension, and pathology as independent risk factors for tube occlusion. Tubing blockages are a common occurrence during HIPEC treatment, leading to prolonged postoperative gastrointestinal functional recovery time. When patients are elderly and have concomitant hypertension and diabetes, along with a histological type of low-grade mucinous tumor, the risk of tube occlusion increases. However, this study did not find a significant correlation between tubing blockage and the incidence of postoperative complications or overall patient survival.\n",
            "ID: 38769533, Title: The quality of reporting in case reports of permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus: a cross-sectional study., Abstract: Although randomized trials and systematic reviews provide the best evidence to guide medical practice, many permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus (PNDM) studies have been published as case reports. However, the quality of these studies has not been assessed. The purpose of this study was to assess the extent to which the current case reports for PNDM comply with the Case Report (CARE) guidelines and to explore variables associated with the reporting. Six English and four Chinese databases were searched from their inception to December 2022 for PNDM case reports. The 23 items CARE checklist was used to measure reporting quality. Primary outcome was the adherence rate of each CARE item and second outcome was total reporting score for each included PNDM case report. Linear and logistic regression analyses were used to examine the connection between five pre-specified predictor variables and the reporting quality. The predictor variables were impact factor of the published journal (<3.4 vs. ≥3.4, categorized according to the median), funding (yes vs. no), language (English vs. other language), published journal type (general vs. special) and year of publication (>2013 vs. ≤ 2013). In total, 105 PNDM case reports were included in this study. None of the 105 PNDM case reports fulfilled all 23 items of the CARE checklist. The response rate of 11 items were under 50%, including prognostic characteristics presentation (0%), patient perspective interpretation (0%), diagnostic challenges statement (2.9%), clinical course summary (21.0%), diagnostic reasoning statement (22.9%), title identification (24.8%), case presentation (33.3%), disease history description (34.3%), strengths and limitations explanation (41.0%), informed consent statement (45.7%), and lesson elucidation (47.6%). This study identified that the PNDM case reports published in higher impact factor journals were statistically associated with a higher reporting quality. The reporting of case reports for PNDM is generally poor. As a result, this information may be misleading to providers, and the clinical applications may be detrimental to patient care. To improve reporting quality, journals should encourage strict adherence to the CARE guidelines.\n",
            "ID: 38769523, Title: ABO and Rhesus blood groups and multiple health outcomes: an umbrella review of systematic reviews with meta-analyses of observational studies., Abstract: Numerous studies have been conducted to investigate the relationship between ABO and Rhesus (Rh) blood groups and various health outcomes. However, a comprehensive evaluation of the robustness of these associations is still lacking. We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane, and several regional databases from their inception until Feb 16, 2024, with the aim of identifying systematic reviews with meta-analyses of observational studies exploring associations between ABO and Rh blood groups and diverse health outcomes. For each association, we calculated the summary effect sizes, corresponding 95% confidence intervals, 95% prediction interval, heterogeneity, small-study effect, and evaluation of excess significance bias. The evidence was evaluated on a grading scale that ranged from convincing (Class I) to weak (Class IV). We assessed the certainty of evidence according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation criteria (GRADE). We also evaluated the methodological quality of included studies using the A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR). AMSTAR contains 11 items, which were scored as high (8-11), moderate (4-7), and low (0-3) quality. We have gotten the registration for protocol on the PROSPERO database (CRD42023409547). The current umbrella review included 51 systematic reviews with meta-analysis articles with 270 associations. We re-calculated each association and found only one convincing evidence (Class I) for an association between blood group B and type 2 diabetes mellitus risk compared with the non-B blood group. It had a summary odds ratio of 1.28 (95% confidence interval: 1.17, 1.40), was supported by 6870 cases with small heterogeneity (I<sup>2</sup> = 13%) and 95% prediction intervals excluding the null value, and without hints of small-study effects (P for Egger's test > 0.10, but the largest study effect was not more conservative than the summary effect size) or excess of significance (P < 0.10, but the value of observed less than expected). And the article was demonstrated with high methodological quality using AMSTAR (score = 9). According to AMSTAR, 18, 32, and 11 studies were categorized as high, moderate, and low quality, respectively. Nine statistically significant associations reached moderate quality based on GRADE. Our findings suggest a potential relationship between ABO and Rh blood groups and adverse health outcomes. Particularly the association between blood group B and type 2 diabetes mellitus risk.\n",
            "ID: 38769507, Title: Socio-behavioral determinants of health-related quality of life among patients with type 2 diabetes: comparison between 2015 and 2018., Abstract: Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a common chronic disease that significantly affects an individual's overall health and well-being. The aim of this study is to investigate the factors that influence the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of patients with T2D. This study conducted using data from 6th phase (2015-2017) and 7th phase (2018-2022) of the Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study (TLGS). Data were collected through a combination of interviews, physical examinations, and laboratory tests. Quality of life questionnaire (SF-12) that consists of 12 questions was used to assess physical and mental health functioning. The generalized estimating equation model was used to assess the association between socio-behavioral factors and changes in HRQoL. The study included 498 patients with T2D. The changes in HRQoL in patients with T2D followed a sex-specific pattern. Analysis of the physical component score (PCS) and the mental component score (MCS) showed a non-significant change in the total score during the three-year longitudinal study. However, the role physical (RP) of the PCS and the social functioning (SF) of the MCS showed a statistically significant change during this period. In addition, sex, body mass index (BMI), and having cardiovascular disease (CVD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) showed a significant association with RP changes, and only job status showed a significant association with SF changes. By recognizing the sex-specific patterns in HRQoL changes and understanding the multifaceted nature of factors such as BMI, CVD and CKD, healthcare professionals can develop targeted interventions that go beyond traditional diabetes management.\n",
            "ID: 38769500, Title: Glomerular crescents are associated with the risk of type 2 diabetic kidney disease progression: a retrospective cohort study., Abstract: Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) stands as the predominant cause of chronic kidney disease and end-stage kidney disease. Its diverse range of manifestations complicates the treatment approach for patients. Although kidney biopsy is considered the gold standard for diagnosis, it lacks precision in predicting the progression of kidney dysfunction. Herein, we addressed whether the presence of glomerular crescents is linked to the outcomes in patients with biopsy-confirmed type 2 DKD. We performed a retrospective evaluation, involving 327 patients diagnosed with biopsy-confirmed DKD in the context of type 2 diabetes, excluding cases with other glomerular diseases, from nine tertiary hospitals. Hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated using a Cox regression model to assess the risk of kidney disease progression, defined as either ≥ 50% decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rates or the development of end-stage kidney disease, based on the presence of glomerular crescents. Out of the 327 patients selected, ten patients had glomerular crescents observed in their biopsied tissues. Over the follow-up period (median of 19 months, with a maximum of 18 years), the crescent group exhibited a higher risk of kidney disease progression than the no crescent group, with an adjusted HR of 2.82 (1.32-6.06) (P = 0.008). The presence of heavy proteinuria was associated with an increased risk of developing glomerular crescents. The presence of glomerular crescents is indeed linked to the progression of type 2 DKD. Therefore, it is important to determine whether there is an additional immune-mediated glomerulonephritis requiring immunomodulation, and it may be prudent to monitor the histology and repeat a biopsy.\n",
            "ID: 38769477, Title: Air pollution, life's essential 8, and risk of severe non-alcoholic fatty liver disease among individuals with type 2 diabetes., Abstract: The impacts of long-term exposure to air pollution on the risk of subsequent non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) among participants with type 2 diabetes (T2D) is ambiguous. The modifying role of Life's Essential 8 (LE8) remains unknown. This study included 23,129 participants with T2D at baseline from the UK Biobank. Annual means of nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>X</sub>), and particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>2.5-10</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>) were estimated using the land-use regression model for each participant. The associations between exposure to air pollution and the risk of severe NAFLD were evaluated using Cox proportional hazard models. The effect modification of LE8 was assessed through stratified analyses. During a median 13.6 years of follow-up, a total of 1,123 severe NAFLD cases occurred. After fully adjusting for potential covariates, higher levels of PM<sub>2.5</sub> (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.12, 95%CI:1.02, 1.23 per interquartile range [IQR] increment), NO<sub>2</sub> (HR = 1.15, 95%CI:1.04, 1.27), and NO<sub>X</sub> (HR = 1.08, 95%CI:1.01, 1.17) were associated with an elevated risk of severe NAFLD. In addition, LE8 score was negatively associated with the risk of NAFLD (HR = 0.97, 95% CI: 0.97, 0.98 per point increment). Compared with those who had low air pollution and high LE8, participants with a high air pollution exposure and low LE8 had a significantly higher risk of severe NAFLD. Our findings suggest that long-term exposure to air pollution was associated with an elevated risk of severe NAFLD among participants with T2D. A lower LE8 may increase the adverse impacts of air pollution on NAFLD.\n",

            "ID: 38769435, Title: Transcriptional control of metabolism by interferon regulatory factors., Abstract: Interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) comprise a family of nine transcription factors in mammals. IRFs exert broad effects on almost all aspects of immunity but are best known for their role in the antiviral response. Over the past two decades, IRFs have been implicated in metabolic physiology and pathophysiology, partly as a result of their known functions in immune cells, but also because of direct actions in adipocytes, hepatocytes, myocytes and neurons. This Review focuses predominantly on IRF3 and IRF4, which have been the subject of the most intense investigation in this area. IRF3 is located in the cytosol and undergoes activation and nuclear translocation in response to various signals, including stimulation of Toll-like receptors, RIG-I-like receptors and the cGAS-STING pathways. IRF3 promotes weight gain, primarily by inhibiting adipose thermogenesis, and also induces inflammation and insulin resistance using both weight-dependent and weight-independent mechanisms. IRF4, meanwhile, is generally pro-thermogenic and anti-inflammatory and has profound effects on lipogenesis and lipolysis. Finally, new data are emerging on the role of other IRF family members in metabolic homeostasis. Taken together, data indicate that IRFs serve as critical yet underappreciated integrators of metabolic and inflammatory stress.\n",
            "ID: 38769420, Title: Functional canonical RNAi in mice expressing a truncated Dicer isoform and long dsRNA., Abstract: Canonical RNA interference (RNAi) is sequence-specific mRNA degradation guided by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) made by RNase III Dicer from long double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). RNAi roles include gene regulation, antiviral immunity or defense against transposable elements. In mammals, RNAi is constrained by Dicer's adaptation to produce another small RNA class-microRNAs. However, a truncated Dicer isoform (ΔHEL1) supporting RNAi exists in mouse oocytes. A homozygous mutation to express only the truncated ΔHEL1 variant causes dysregulation of microRNAs and perinatal lethality in mice. Here, we report the phenotype and canonical RNAi activity in Dicer<sup>ΔHEL1/wt</sup> mice, which are viable, show minimal miRNome changes, but their endogenous siRNA levels are an order of magnitude higher. We show that siRNA production in vivo is limited by available dsRNA, but not by Protein kinase R, a dsRNA sensor of innate immunity. dsRNA expression from a transgene yields sufficient siRNA levels to induce efficient RNAi in heart and muscle. Dicer<sup>ΔHEL1/wt</sup> mice with enhanced canonical RNAi offer a platform for examining potential and limits of mammalian RNAi in vivo.\n",
            "ID: 38769364, Title: A dynamic probabilistic model of the onset and interaction of cardio-metabolic comorbidities on an ageing adult population., Abstract: Comorbidity is widespread in the ageing population, implying multiple and complex medical needs for individuals and a public health burden. Determining risk factors and predicting comorbidity development can help identify at-risk subjects and design prevention strategies. Using socio-demographic and clinical data from approximately 11,000 subjects monitored over 11 years in the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, we develop a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) to model the onset and interaction of three cardio-metabolic comorbidities, namely type 2 diabetes (T2D), hypertension, and heart problems. The DBN allows us to identify risk factors for developing each morbidity, simulate ageing progression over time, and stratify the population based on the risk of outcome occurrence. By applying hierarchical agglomerative clustering to the simulated, dynamic risk of experiencing morbidities, we identified patients with similar risk patterns and the variables contributing to their discrimination. The network reveals a direct joint effect of biomarkers and lifestyle on outcomes over time, such as the impact of fasting glucose, HbA1c, and BMI on T2D development. Mediated cross-relationships between comorbidities also emerge, showcasing the interconnected nature of these health issues. The model presents good calibration and discrimination ability, particularly in predicting the onset of T2D (iAUC-ROC = 0.828, iAUC-PR = 0.294) and survival (iAUC-ROC = 0.827, iAUC-PR = 0.311). Stratification analysis unveils two distinct clusters for all comorbidities, effectively discriminated by variables like HbA1c for T2D and age at baseline for heart problems. The developed DBN constitutes an effective, highly-explainable predictive risk tool for simulating and stratifying the dynamic risk of developing cardio-metabolic comorbidities. Its use could help identify the effects of risk factors and develop health policies that prevent the occurrence of comorbidities.\n",
            "ID: 38769347, Title: Self-supervised learning of accelerometer data provides new insights for sleep and its association with mortality., Abstract: Sleep is essential to life. Accurate measurement and classification of sleep/wake and sleep stages is important in clinical studies for sleep disorder diagnoses and in the interpretation of data from consumer devices for monitoring physical and mental well-being. Existing non-polysomnography sleep classification techniques mainly rely on heuristic methods developed in relatively small cohorts. Thus, we aimed to establish the accuracy of wrist-worn accelerometers for sleep stage classification and subsequently describe the association between sleep duration and efficiency (proportion of total time asleep when in bed) with mortality outcomes. We developed a self-supervised deep neural network for sleep stage classification using concurrent laboratory-based polysomnography and accelerometry. After exclusion, 1448 participant nights of data were used for training. The difference between polysomnography and the model classifications on the external validation was 34.7 min (95% limits of agreement (LoA): -37.8-107.2 min) for total sleep duration, 2.6 min for REM duration (95% LoA: -68.4-73.4 min) and 32.1 min (95% LoA: -54.4-118.5 min) for NREM duration. The sleep classifier was deployed in the UK Biobank with 100,000 participants to study the association of sleep duration and sleep efficiency with all-cause mortality. Among 66,214 UK Biobank participants, 1642 mortality events were observed. Short sleepers (<6 h) had a higher risk of mortality compared to participants with normal sleep duration of 6-7.9 h, regardless of whether they had low sleep efficiency (Hazard ratios (HRs): 1.58; 95% confidence intervals (CIs): 1.19-2.11) or high sleep efficiency (HRs: 1.45; 95% CIs: 1.16-1.81). Deep-learning-based sleep classification using accelerometers has a fair to moderate agreement with polysomnography. Our findings suggest that having short overnight sleep confers mortality risk irrespective of sleep continuity.\n",
            "ID: 38769300, Title: Integrating single cell expression quantitative trait loci summary statistics to understand complex trait risk genes., Abstract: Transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) is a popular approach to dissect the functional consequence of disease associated non-coding variants. Most existing TWAS use bulk tissues and may not have the resolution to reveal cell-type specific target genes. Single-cell expression quantitative trait loci (sc-eQTL) datasets are emerging. The largest bulk- and sc-eQTL datasets are most conveniently available as summary statistics, but have not been broadly utilized in TWAS. Here, we present a new method EXPRESSO (EXpression PREdiction with Summary Statistics Only), to analyze sc-eQTL summary statistics, which also integrates 3D genomic data and epigenomic annotation to prioritize causal variants. EXPRESSO substantially improves existing methods. We apply EXPRESSO to analyze multi-ancestry GWAS datasets for 14 autoimmune diseases. EXPRESSO uniquely identifies 958 novel gene x trait associations, which is 26% more than the second-best method. Among them, 492 are unique to cell type level analysis and missed by TWAS using whole blood. We also develop a cell type aware drug repurposing pipeline, which leverages EXPRESSO results to identify drug compounds that can reverse disease gene expressions in relevant cell types. Our results point to multiple drugs with therapeutic potentials, including metformin for type 1 diabetes, and vitamin K for ulcerative colitis.\n",
            "ID: 38769296, Title: Production of deoxycholic acid by low-abundant microbial species is associated with impaired glucose metabolism., Abstract: Alterations in gut microbiota composition are suggested to contribute to cardiometabolic diseases, in part by producing bioactive molecules. Some of the metabolites are produced by very low abundant bacterial taxa, which largely have been neglected due to limits of detection. However, the concentration of microbially produced metabolites from these taxa can still reach high levels and have substantial impact on host physiology. To explore this concept, we focused on the generation of secondary bile acids by 7α-dehydroxylating bacteria and demonstrated that addition of a very low abundant bacteria to a community can change the metabolic output dramatically. We show that Clostridium scindens converts cholic acid into the secondary bile acid deoxycholic acid (DCA) very efficiently even though the abundance of C. scindens is low, but still detectable by digital droplet PCR. We also show that colonization of germ-free female mice with a community containing C. scindens induces DCA production and affects host metabolism. Finally, we show that DCA correlates with impaired glucose metabolism and a worsened lipid profile in individuals with type 2 diabetes, which implies that this metabolic pathway may contribute to the development of cardiometabolic disease.\n",
            "ID: 38769291, Title: First report of anthracnose of <i>Lithocarpus polystachyus</i> caused by <i>Colletotrichum fructicola</i> in China., Abstract: Lithocarpus polystachyus (Wall. ex A. DC.), an economically valuable plant species belonging to the Fagaceae family, has been used as herbal tea to prevent diabetes because of the high content of flavonoids and dihydrochalcones in the leaves (Shang et al. 2022). In July 2022, the severe leaf lesion on L. polystachyus was first observed in Yongshun County, Xiangxi autonomous prefecture (28°45'34''N, 109°40'11''E), Hunan province, China. Yongshun County is characterized by hills and mountains, situated in a subtropical region with a mild and humid climate. A second outbreak in July 2023 was observed in the same area. The observed incident rates in the past two years were 87.3% and 90.6%, respectively. Once infected, almost all plant leaves will be infected, leading to a substantial reduction in the yield of L. polystachyus. The disease presented symptoms characterized by round or irregularly shaped lesions that initially manifested as brown spots. These lesions frequently merged into larger, dark-brown areas along the leaf margins before eventually wilting. To ascertain the pathogenic species responsible for this disease, fungal isolation was conducted using a tissue separation method (Xu et al. 2023). The infected leaf tissues were surface-disinfected with 75% ethanol and 0.1% HgCl then small pieces (1×1 cm), were placed onto potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium (Sigma-Aldrich, 70139) and incubated at 28°C for 6-9 days. Colonies were villiform and initially white, becoming gray after 6 days. Sterilized dissecting needles were used to pick single hyphal tips from the edge of the colonies and placed onto PDA for strain purification. After 15 days, the purified colonies grew fluffy white hyphae with abundant conidia. The conidia were cylindrical, had round ends, and ranged from 5.75 to 14.83 μm long and 1.75 to 2.38 μm wide (n=50). According to morphological and cultural characteristics, these isolates were preliminarily identified as Colletotrichum fructicola Prihast., L. Cai & K.D. Hyde (Damm et al. 2012). To further affirm the identity of the pathogen, DNA was extracted from mycelia using a DNA extraction kit (Sigma-Aldrich, G2N70). The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, the transcription elongation factor (TEF), and the actin (ACT) gene were then amplified from genomic DNA extracted from three isolates (Cof1, Cof2, and Cof3) using specific primers. The primers utilized were ITS1/ITS4 (White et al. 1990), EF1-728F/EF1-986R and ACT-512F/ACT-783R (Carbone and Kohn 1999) for ITS region, transcription elongation factor gene and actin gene amplification, respectively. Sequence identity indicated that these isolates were highly homologous to C. fructicola. The ITS (Genbank No. PP002156, OR880553 and OR880554), TEF (No. PP061421, PP061422 and PP061423), and ACT (No. PP061418, PP061419 and PP061420) sequences of the isolates Cof1, Cof2, and Cof3 shared 99 to 100% identity with their counterparts (No. OR083309, MF627961, and OQ427895) in C. fructicola, respectively. A neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree constructed using MEGA11 (Tamura et al. 2021) also indicated that these isolates were C. fructicola. Both morphological and molecular characteristics confirmed the identification of this pathogen as C. fructicola. Colletotrichum species are known to cause anthracnose disease in a variety of economically important crops (Sharma and Kulshrestha 2015). To further validate the ability of the isolated C. fructicola to induce the same symptoms as observed in the field, the pathogenicity assay was assessed following Koch's postulates (Gradmann, 2014). Conidial suspensions (1×105 conidia per mL) from three isolates were individually inoculated onto artificially wounded leaves of 3-year-old L. polystachyus. Negative controls were established by inoculating leaf wounds with sterile distilled water. The plants were incubated in a greenhouse at 28°C and 90% humidity with a 12-h photoperiod. The experiment was replicated three times. Necrotic lesions were observed on all pathogen-inoculated wounds within 6 days after inoculation, whereas controls showed no observable symptoms. Morphological and molecular characterization of re-isolated pathogens from infected leaves indicated that the pathogens were identical. To our knowledge, this is the first report of anthracnose of L. polystachyus caused by C. fructicola in China. Farmers in the local mountainous areas are economically reliant on L. polystachyus production, while anthracnose has caused over half of the trees to lose their commercial value, resulting in significant economic losses. Our findings hold great promise for advancing strategies in the prevention and treatment of anthracnose in L. polystachyus.\n",

            "ID: 38769229, Title: Impact of etiology, sex, diabetes mellitus and remission status on erythrocytic profile in patients with cushing's syndrome: a large population database study., Abstract: The study aimed to characterize the erythrocytic profile in patients with cushing's syndrome (CS) versus controls from the normal population according to etiology, sex, presence of diabetes mellitus (DM) and hypercortisolemia remission status. This retrospective cohort analysis compared erythrocytic parameters between patients with CS of pituitary (CD) and adrenal (aCS) etiology and age, sex, body mass index (BMI) and socioeconomic status-matched controls in a 1:5 ratio. Laboratory values at baseline were calculated as mean values during the year preceding CS diagnosis, and over one year thereafter. The cohort included 397 CS patients (68.26% female; mean age 51.11 ± 16.85 years) and 1970 controls. Patients with CS had significantly higher baseline median levels of hemoglobin (Hgb) (13.70 g/dL vs. 13.12 g/dL [p < 0.0001]) and hematocrit (Hct) (41.64% vs. 39.80% [p < 0.0001]) compared to controls. These differences were observed for both CD and aCS and for both sexes. Patients who attained remission had Hgb and Hct levels comparable to controls (13.20 g/dL and 40.08% in patients with CD and aCS vs. 13.20 g/dL and 39.98% in controls). Meanwhile, those with persistent/recurrent disease maintained elevated levels. Patients with comorbid DM had similar Hgb but higher Hct (p = 0.0419), while patients without DM showed elevated erythrocytic values compared to controls (p < 0.0001). Our data illustrates that erythrocytic parameters are directly influenced by glucocorticoid excess as Hgb and Hct are higher in patients with CS, and normalize after remission. We have identified the influence of DM on erythrocytic parameters in patients with CS for the first time.\n",
            "ID: 38769223, Title: Formulation of Saxagliptin Oral Films: Optimization, Physicochemical Characterization, In-Vivo Assessment, and In-Vitro Real-Time Release Monitoring via a Novel Polyaniline Nanoparticles-Based Solid-Contact Screen Printed Ion-Selective Electrode., Abstract: Oral dispersible films have received broad interest due to fast drug absorption and no first-path metabolism, leading to high bioavailability and better patient compliance. Saxagliptin (SXG) is an antidiabetic drug that undergoes first-path metabolism, resulting in a less active metabolite, so the development of SXG oral dispersible films (SXG-ODFs) improves SXG bioavailability. The formula optimisation included a response surface experimental design and the impact of three formulation factors, the type and concentration of polymer and plasticiser concentration on in-vitro disintegration time and folding endurance. Two optimised SXG-ODFs prepared using either polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) or hydroxypropyl methylcellulose were investigated. SXG-ODFs prepared with PVA demonstrated a superior rapid disintegration time, ranging from 17 to 890 s, with the fastest disintegration time recorded at 17 s. These short durations can be attributed to the hydrophilic nature of PVA, facilitating rapid hydration and disintegration upon contact with saliva. Additionally, PVA-based films displayed remarkable folding endurance, surpassing 200 folds without rupture, indicating flexibility and stability. The high tensile strength of PVA-based films further underscores their robust mechanical properties, with tensile strength values reaching up to 4.53 MPa. SXG exhibits a UV absorption wavelength of around 212 nm, posing challenges for traditional quantitative spectrophotometric analysis, so a polyaniline nanoparticles-based solid-contact screen-printed ion-selective electrode (SP-ISE) was employed for the determination of SXG release profile effectively in comparison to HPLC. SP-ISE showed a better real-time release profile of SXG-ODFs, and the optimised formula showed lower blood glucose levels than commercial tablets.\n",

This cross-sectional study involved 938 hospitalized patients with T2DM. Linear regression models were used to explore the relationship between DHEA and DHEAS and the BMD at different skeletal sites. Multinominal logistic regression models and the restricted cubic spline (RCS) were used to evaluate the associations of DHEA and DHEAS with the risks of osteopenia and/or osteoporosis. In postmenopausal women with T2DM, after adjustment for confounders including testosterone and estradiol, DHEA showed a significant positive correlation with lumbar spine BMD (P = 0.013). Moreover, DHEAS exhibited significant positive correlations with BMD at three skeletal sites: including femoral neck, total hip, and lumbar spine (all P < 0.05). Low DHEA and DHEAS levels were associated with increased risk of osteopenia and/or osteoporosis (all P < 0.05) and the risk of osteoporosis gradually decreased with increasing DHEAS levels (P overall = 0.018, P-nonlinear = 0.559). However, DHEA and DHEAS levels in men over the age of 50 with T2DM were not associated with any of above outcomes. In patients with T2DM, independent of testosterone and estradiol, higher DHEA and DHEAS levels are associated with higher BMD and lower risk of osteopenia/osteoporosis in postmenopausal women but not men over the age of 50.\n",
            "ID: 38769135, Title: Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index is associated with adverse outcomes in patients with hypertension: the Fukushima Cohort study., Abstract: Malnutrition is reportedly associated with adverse clinical outcomes in various populations. However, associations between nutritional status and adverse outcomes in patients with hypertension have not been sufficiently elucidated. We therefore aimed to investigate the impact of nutritional status as evaluated by the Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index (GNRI) on adverse outcomes in patients with hypertension. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 1588 hypertensive patients enrolled in the Fukushima Cohort Study. Participants were categorized into tertiles (T1-T3) according to GNRI at baseline. The primary endpoint of the present study was a kidney event, defined as a combination of a 50% decline in eGFR from baseline and end-stage kidney disease requiring kidney replacement therapy. Associations between GNRI and kidney events were assessed using Kaplan-Meier curves and multivariate Cox regression analyses. Median age was 64 years, 55% were men, median eGFR was 63.1 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, and median GNRI was 101.3. The lower GNRI group (T1) showed an increased incidence of kidney events in the Kaplan-Meier curve analysis. Compared to the highest GNRI group (T3), lower GNRI carried a higher risk of kidney events for both T2 (hazard ratio [HR] 1.38, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.71-2.68) and T1 (HR 3.59, 95%CI 1.96-6.63). Similar relationships were observed for risks of all-cause death and cardiovascular events. Lower GNRI was associated with kidney events, all-cause death, and cardiovascular events in patients with hypertension. Nutritional status as evaluated by GNRI could offer a simple and useful predictor of adverse outcomes in this population.\n",
            "ID: 38769127, Title: Protein carbonylation causes sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload by increasing intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> level in ventricular myocytes., Abstract: Diabetes is commonly associated with an elevated level of reactive carbonyl species due to alteration of glucose and fatty acid metabolism. These metabolic changes cause an abnormality in cardiac Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulation that can lead to cardiomyopathies. In this study, we explored how the reactive α-dicarbonyl methylglyoxal (MGO) affects Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulation in mouse ventricular myocytes. Analysis of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics revealed that MGO (200 μM) increases action potential (AP)-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca<sup>2+</sup> load, with a limited effect on L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients and SERCA-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake. At the same time, MGO significantly slowed down cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> extrusion by Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger (NCX). MGO also increased the frequency of Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves during rest and these Ca<sup>2+</sup> release events were abolished by an external solution with zero [Na<sup>+</sup>] and [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]. Adrenergic receptor activation with isoproterenol (10 nM) increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients and SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> load, but it also triggered spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves in 27% of studied cells. Pretreatment of myocytes with MGO increased the fraction of cells with Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves during adrenergic receptor stimulation by 163%. Measurements of intracellular [Na<sup>+</sup>] revealed that MGO increases cytosolic [Na<sup>+</sup>] by 57% from the maximal effect produced by the Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup> ATPase inhibitor ouabain (20 μM). This increase in cytosolic [Na<sup>+</sup>] was a result of activation of a tetrodotoxin-sensitive Na<sup>+</sup> influx, but not an inhibition of Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup> ATPase. An increase in cytosolic [Na<sup>+</sup>] after treating cells with ouabain produced similar effects on Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulation as MGO. These results suggest that protein carbonylation can affect cardiac Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulation by increasing cytosolic [Na<sup>+</sup>] via a tetrodotoxin-sensitive pathway. This, in turn, reduces Ca<sup>2+</sup> extrusion by NCX, causing SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload and spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves.\n",
            "ID: 38769046, Title: Perinatal factors and early neonatal outcomes of abnormal birthweight infants in Hangzhou, China, 2015-2021: a retrospective cohort study., Abstract: This study aimed to investigate the perinatal factors and early neonatal outcomes of abnormal birth weight (ABW) in Hangzhou, China from 2015 to 2021. A retrospective cohort study was designed to analyse the data of 76 847 newborns, in which the case groups included 3042 cases of low birth weight (LBW) and 2941 cases of fetal macrosomia (MAC), and 70 864 cases of normal weight were as the reference group. The incidence of LBW and MAC was 3.96% and 3.83% in Hangzhou, China from 2015 to 2021. Prematurity (<37 weeks), multiple births, hospitalisation >7 days, fetal anomalies, caesarean section, pregnancy complications, maternal coinfection with pathogens and summer births would be correlated with the incidence of LBW (ORs=43.50, 7.60, 2.09, 1.89, 1.57, 1.28, 1.19 and 1.18, all p<0.05). Factors such as post-term pregnancy (>41 weeks), scarred uterus, anterior vaginal incision and gravidity ≥2 were correlated with decreased incidence of LBW, with ORs of 0.05, 0.54, 0.65 and 0.80. Moreover, caesarean delivery, post-term pregnancy (> 41 weeks), parity ≥1, lateral vaginal incision, gravidity ≥2, hospitalisation >7 days, winter births and pregnancy complications also have association with the incidence of MAC (ORs=3.92, 2.73, 2.19, 1.87, 1.22, 1.20, 1.17 and 1.13, all p<0.05) while prematurity (<37 weeks), scarred uterus and anterior vaginal incision have close association with decreased incidence of MAC, with ORs of 0.07, 0.21 and 0.74 (all p<0.05). There was a trend of yearly increase in ABW in Hangzhou, China from 2015 to 2021. Several neonatal and maternal-related variables such as caesarean section, pregnancy complications and hospitalisation >7 days are associated with the odds of LBW and MAC, however, factors such as pregnancy with scarred uterus relate to the decrease of ABW. Close monitoring and intervention during pregnancy are essential to reduce the occurrence of ABW.\n",
            "ID: 38769035, Title: Comprehensive outcomes after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass with a near-complete 15-year follow-up., Abstract: Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass has a well-established safety and efficacy profile in the short and mid-term. Long-term outcomes remain limited in the literature, especially for follow-up periods of >10 years. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the long-term durability and safety of laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass over a near-complete 15-year follow-up. This is a single-center retrospective cohort study of patients who underwent primary laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass between 2008 and 2009 with ≥14-year follow-up. Data collected and analyzed were weight loss, obesity-related medical condition resolution and recurrence, weight recurrence, complication rate, and mortality rate. A total of 264 patients were included. Patients were predominantly female (81.8%), and the mean age and preoperative body mass index were 48.5 ± 12.2 years and 44.9 ± 7.3 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, respectively. The maximum mean percentage total weight loss achieved at 1 year was 31.5% ± 5.7% and was consistently >20% throughout follow-up. Sustained resolution of obesity-related medical conditions was achieved with a remission rate of 60.8% for type 2 diabetes mellitus, 46.7% for denoted dyslipidemia, and 40% for hypertension. Obesity-related medical condition recurrence was observed with a recurrence rate of 24.1% for type 2 diabetes mellitus, 17.9% for hypertension, and 14.8% for denoted dyslipidemia. Significant factors associated with weight loss were maximum percentage total weight loss and preoperative type 2 diabetes mellitus. Over 15 years, the weight recurrence rate was 51.1%, with predictors of higher preoperative body mass index and preoperative type 2 diabetes mellitus. Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass provides sustainable weight loss over a 15-year period, with consistent long-term weight-loss outcomes and resolution of obesity-related medical conditions sustained for ≥10 years after surgery.\n",
            "ID: 38768417, Title: Assessing Patterns of CGM use and Metrics of Glycemic Control in T1D and T2D Patients in the Veterans Healthcare System: Integrating CGM Device Data with EHR Data., Abstract: To integrate long-term daily continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) device data with electronic health records (EHR) for type 1 and type 2 diabetes patients in the Veterans Affairs Healthcare System to assess real-world patterns of CGM use and the reliability of EHR-based CGM information. This observational study used Dexcom CGM device data linked with EHR (from 2015-2020) for a large national cohort of diabetes patients. We tracked the initiation and consistency of CGM use, assessed concordance of CGM use and measures of glucose control between CGM device data and EHR records, and examined results by age, ethnicity, and diabetes type. The time from pharmacy release of CGM to patients to initiation of uploading CGM data to Dexcom servers averaged three weeks but demonstrated wide variation among individuals; importantly, this delay decreased markedly over the later years. The average daily wear time of CGM exceeded 22 hours over nearly three years of follow-up. Patterns of CGM use were generally consistent across age, race/ethnicity groups and diabetes type. There was strong concordance between EHR-based estimates of CGM use and Dexcom CGM wear time and between estimates of glucose control from both sources. The study demonstrates our ability to reliably integrate CGM devices and EHR data to provide valuable insights into CGM use patterns. The results indicate in the real-world environment that CGM is worn consistently over many years for both type 1 and type 2 patients within the Veterans Affairs Healthcare System and is similar across major race/ethnicity and age groups.\n",
            "ID: 38768416, Title: Continuous glucose monitoring and recreational scuba diving in type 1 diabetes: head-to-head comparison between Free Style Libre 3 and Dexcom G7 performance., Abstract: Background Scuba diving was previously excluded because of hypoglycemic risks for type 1 diabetic patients (T1DM). Specific eligibility criteria and a safety protocol have been defined, while continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems have enhanced diabetes management. This study aims to assess the feasibility and accuracy of CGM Dexcom G7 (DG7) and Free Style Libre 3 (FSL3) in a setting of repetitive scuba diving in T1DM, exploring the possibility of non-adjunctive use. Material and methods The study was conducted during an event of Diabete Sommerso® association in November 2023. Participants followed a safety protocol, with capillary glucose as reference standard (Beurer GL50Evo). Sensors accuracy was evaluated through Median and Mean Absolute Relative Difference (MeARD and MARD) and Surveillance Error Grid (SEG) Analysis. Sub-analyses were performed by glycemic range, timing, gender. Data distribution and correlation was estimated by Spearman test and Bland-Altman plots. The ability of sensors to identify hypoglycaemia was assessed by contingency tables. Participants completed a satisfation questionnaire. Results Data from 202 dives of 13 patients were collected. The overall MARD was 31% for DG7 and 14.2% for FSL3, MeARD 19.7% and 11.6% respectively. FSL3 exhibited better accuracy in normoglycemic and hyperglycemic ranges. SEG analysis showed 82.1% (DG7) and 97.4% (FSL3) data on no-risk zone. FSL3 better performed on hypoglycemia identification (diagnostic odds ratio of 254.10 vs 58.95). Neither of sensors reached the MARD for non-adjunctive use. Patient satisfaction favored FSL3 for size and minimal bulk, while DG7 received positive feedback for versatility. Conclusions The study reveals FSL3 superior accuracy compared to DG7 in a setting of repetitive scuba diving in T1DM, except for hypoglycemic range. Both sensors fails to achieve accuracy for non-adjunctive use. Capillary tests remain crucial for safe dive planning, and sensor data should be interpreted cautiously. We suggest exploring additional factors potentially influencing sensor performance.\n",

            "ID: 38768366, Title: Glucose Regulation of β-Cell KATP Channels: It Is Time for a New Model!, Abstract: An agreed-upon consensus model of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from healthy β-cells is essential for understanding diabetes pathophysiology. Since the discovery of the KATP channel in 1984, an oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos)-driven rise in ATP has been assumed to close KATP channels to initiate insulin secretion. This model lacks any evidence, genetic or otherwise, that mitochondria possess the bioenergetics to raise the ATP/ADP ratio to the triggering threshold, and conflicts with genetic evidence demonstrating that OxPhos is dispensable for insulin secretion. It also conflates the stoichiometric yield of OxPhos with thermodynamics, and overestimates OxPhos by failing to account for established features of β-cell metabolism, such as leak, anaplerosis, cataplerosis, and NADPH production that subtract from the efficiency of mitochondrial ATP production. We have proposed an alternative model, based on the spatial and bioenergetic specializations of β-cell metabolism, in which glycolysis initiates insulin secretion. The evidence for this model includes that 1) glycolysis has high control strength over insulin secretion; 2) glycolysis is active at the correct time to explain KATP channel closure; 3) plasma membrane-associated glycolytic enzymes control KATP channels; 4) pyruvate kinase has favorable bioenergetics, relative to OxPhos, for raising ATP/ADP; and 5) OxPhos stalls before membrane depolarization and increases after. Although several key experiments remain to evaluate this model, the 1984 model is based purely on circumstantial evidence and must be rescued by causal, mechanistic experiments if it is to endure.\n",
            "ID: 38768365, Title: Glucose Regulation of β-Cell KATP Channels: Is a New Model Needed?, Abstract: The canonical model of glucose-induced increase in insulin secretion involves the metabolism of glucose via glycolysis and the citrate cycle, resulting in increased ATP synthesis by the respiratory chain and the closure of ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channels. The resulting plasma membrane depolarization, followed by Ca2+ influx through L-type Ca2+ channels, then induces insulin granule fusion. Merrins and colleagues have recently proposed an alternative model whereby KATP channels are controlled by pyruvate kinase, using glycolytic and mitochondrial phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to generate microdomains of high ATP/ADP immediately adjacent to KATP channels. This model presents several challenges. First, how mitochondrially generated PEP, but not ATP produced abundantly by the mitochondrial F1F0-ATP synthase, can gain access to the proposed microdomains is unclear. Second, ATP/ADP fluctuations imaged immediately beneath the plasma membrane closely resemble those in the bulk cytosol. Third, ADP privation of the respiratory chain at high glucose, suggested to drive alternating, phased-locked generation by mitochondria of ATP or PEP, has yet to be directly demonstrated. Finally, the approaches used to explore these questions may be complicated by off-target effects. We suggest instead that Ca2+ changes, well known to affect both ATP generation and consumption, likely drive cytosolic ATP/ADP oscillations that in turn regulate KATP channels and membrane potential. Thus, it remains to be demonstrated that a new model is required to replace the existing, mitochondrial bioenergetics-based model.\n",

            "ID: 38768242, Title: Transgender health objectives of training for adult Endocrinology and Metabolism programs: Outcomes of a modified-Delphi study., Abstract: Transgender people encounter significant barriers when seeking timely, high-quality healthcare, resulting in unmet medical needs with increased rates of diabetes, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and HIV. The paucity of postgraduate medical education to invest in standardization of transgender health training sustains these barriers, leaving physicians feeling unprepared and averse to provide transgender health care. Closing this education gap and improving transgender healthcare necessitates the development of consensus-built transgender health objectives of training (THOOT), particularly in Adult Endocrinology and Metabolism Residency programs. We conducted a two-round modified-Delphi process involving a nationally representative panel of experts, including Adult Endocrinology and Metabolism program directors, physician content experts, residents, and transgender community members, to identify THOOT for inclusion in Canadian Endocrinology and Metabolism Residency programs. Participants used a 5-point Likert scale to assess THOOT importance for curricular inclusion, with opportunities for written feedback. Data was collected through Qualtrics and analyzed after each round. In the first Delphi round, panelists reviewed and rated 81 literature extracted THOOT, achieving consensus on all objectives. Following panelists' feedback, 5 THOOT were added, 9 removed, 34 consolidated into 12 objectives, and 47 were rephrased or retained. In the second Delphi round, panelists assessed 55 THOOT. Consensus was established for 8 THOOT. Program directors' post-Delphi feedback further consolidated objectives to arrive at 4 THOOT for curriculum inclusion. To our knowledge, this is the first time a consensus-based approach has been used to establish THOOT for any subspecialty postgraduate medicine program across Canada or the United States. Our results lay the foundation towards health equity and social justice in transgender health medical education, offering a blueprint for future innovations.\n",
            "ID: 38768222, Title: A novel fusion of genetic grey wolf optimization and kernel extreme learning machines for precise diabetic eye disease classification., Abstract: In response to the growing number of diabetes cases worldwide, Our study addresses the escalating issue of diabetic eye disease (DED), a significant contributor to vision loss globally, through a pioneering approach. We propose a novel integration of a Genetic Grey Wolf Optimization (G-GWO) algorithm with a Fully Convolutional Encoder-Decoder Network (FCEDN), further enhanced by a Kernel Extreme Learning Machine (KELM) for refined image segmentation and disease classification. This innovative combination leverages the genetic algorithm and grey wolf optimization to boost the FCEDN's efficiency, enabling precise detection of DED stages and differentiation among disease types. Tested across diverse datasets, including IDRiD, DR-HAGIS, and ODIR, our model showcased superior performance, achieving classification accuracies between 98.5% to 98.8%, surpassing existing methods. This advancement sets a new standard in DED detection and offers significant potential for automating fundus image analysis, reducing reliance on manual examination, and improving patient care efficiency. Our findings are crucial to enhancing diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes in DED management.\n",
            "ID: 38768161, Title: Design of a bi-directional methodology for automated assessment of compliance to continuous application of clinical guidelines, and its evaluation in the type 2 diabetes domain., Abstract: We introduce a new approach for automated guideline-based-care quality assessment, the bidirectional knowledge-based assessment of compliance (BiKBAC) method, and the DiscovErr system, which implements it. Our methodology compares the guideline's Asbru-based formal representation, including its intentions, with the longitudinal medical record, using a top-down and bottom-up approach. Partial matches are resolved using fuzzy temporal logic. The system was evaluated in the type 2 Diabetes management domain, comparing it to three expert clinicians, including two diabetes experts. The system and the experts commented on the management of 10 patients, randomly selected from 2,000 diabetes patients. On average, each record spanned 5.23 years; the data included 1,584 medical transactions. The system provided 279 comments. The experts made 181 different unique comments. The completeness (recall) of the system was 91% when the gold standard was comments made by at least two of the three experts, and 98%, compared to comments made by all three experts. The experts also assessed all of the 114 medication-therapy-related comments, and a random 35% of the 165 tests-and-monitoring-related comments. The system's correctness (precision) was 81%, compared to comments judged as correct by both diabetes experts, and 91%, compared to comments judged as correct by one diabetes expert and at least as partially correct by the other. 89% of the comments were judged as important by both diabetes experts, 8% were judged as important by one expert, and 3% were judged as less important by both experts. Adding the validated system comments to the experts' comments, the completeness scores of the experts were 75%, 60%, and 55%; the expert correctness scores were respectively 99%, 91%, and 88%. Thus, the system could be ranked first in completeness and second in correctness. We conclude that systems such as DiscovErr can effectively assess the quality of continuous guideline-based care.\n",
            "ID: 38768159, Title: Factors associated with oral health care behavior of people with type 2 diabetes mellitus: A hospital-based, cross-sectional study., Abstract: Oral healthcare behavior determines oral health status and the incidence of oral diseases. People with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are at-risk of having low oral healthcare behavior and disease-related oral health. To investigate the oral health status and factors associated with oral healthcare behavior among people with T2DM in Thailand. In total, 401 people with T2DM participated in the study based on their attendance at a non-communicable disease clinic at sub-district health promotion hospitals in Bueng Kan, a north-eastern province in Thailand. A structured questionnaire was used to obtain variables of interest. Linear regression analysis at the 95% confidence interval (CI) was applied. The majority of participants were female (73.8%). More than three-quarters had more than 20 permanent teeth (77.6%), a decay missing filling tooth index was 10.6 teeth/person. Many participants had four permanent occlusal pairs (69.6%), had tooth decay (74.6%), and some participants had tooth filling (32.2%). Statistically significant factors associated with oral healthcare behavior were: having complications associated with diabetes mellitus (Beta = -0.097, 95%CI = -1.653, -0.046), oral health literacy (Beta = 0.119, 95%CI = 0.009, 0.150), educational level (Beta = 0.123, 95%CI = 0.103, 0.949), oral healthcare attitude (Beta = 0.258, 95%CI = 0.143, 0.333), and oral health services (Beta = 0.430, 95%CI = 0.298, 1.408). People with T2DM had good oral health status. People with T2DM with low oral health literacy, low attitude, and low level of oral health services were at a higher risk of poor oral healthcare behavior.\n",
            "ID: 38768141, Title: Prevalence of dyslipidemia, hypertension and diabetes among tribal and rural population in a south Indian forested region., Abstract: While NCDs are in rise globally, tribal and rural populations residing near to reserve forests with limited exposure to modern lifestyles may bear a unique burden. This study investigates the prevalence and risk factors of hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia among these communities. We conducted a cross-sectional study between 2018 and 2020 in the forest-dwelling population of Chamarajanagar, India. Using multistage stratified sampling based on caste and remoteness, we enrolled 608 participants aged over 18 years, including 259 non-tribal and 349 tribal individuals. Data collection includes the administration of STEPS questionnaire and measurement of fasting blood sugar, lipid levels, and blood pressure. The prevalence of diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia were 4.6%, 28.8%, and 85.7%, respectively, among the study population. We also found abnormal levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), Triglycerides (TGA), Total cholesterol (TC), and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)in 4.9%, 82.4%, 22.7%, 5.8%, and 7.4% of participants, respectively. Significant differences were observed in diabetes, LDL abnormality, TGA abnormality, VLDL abnormality, and TC abnormality, but not in hypertension, dyslipidemia, or HDL abnormality, across the Socio Geographic Discrimination Index. We found a significant difference in diabetes and HDL abnormality, but not in hypertension, dyslipidemia, LDL abnormality, TGA abnormality, TC abnormality, or VLDL abnormality, between tribal and non-tribal populations living in the forest-dwelling area. Waist circumference was a significant independent predictor of diabetes among tribal participants, while wealth index, age, and waist circumference were significant predictors of hypertension. There were no significant predictors for dyslipidemia among tribal participants. Our study suggests that tribal population living in a remote area are at a lower risk of developing diabetes compared to non-tribal populations living in the same geographic area. However, the prevalence of hypertension and dyslipidemia among tribal populations remains high and comparable to that of the general population.\n",
            "ID: 38768125, Title: Glucose Responsive Coacervate Protocells from Microfluidics for Diabetic Wound Healing., Abstract: The hyperglycemic pathophysiological environment in diabetic wounds is a major obstacle that impedes the healing process. Glucose-responsive wound healing materials are a promising approach to address this challenge. In this study, complex coacervate-based protocells are introduced for diabetic wound healing. By employing a microfluidic chip with an external mechanical vibrator, uniform coacervate microdroplets are generated via electrostatic interactions between diethylaminoethyl-dextran and double-stranded DNA. The spontaneous assembly of a phospholipid membrane on the droplet surface enhances its biocompatibility. Glucose oxidase and copper peroxide nanodots are integrated into microdroplets, enabling a glucose-responsive cascade that produces hydroxyl radicals as antibacterial agents. These features contribute to efficient antibacterial activity and wound healing in diabetic mice. The present protocells facilitate intelligent wound management, and the design of cascade catalytic coacervates can contribute to the development of various smart vehicles for drug delivery.\n",
            "ID: 38768121, Title: Exploring the path to optimal diabetes care by unravelling the contextual factors affecting access, utilisation, and quality of primary health care in West Africa: A scoping review protocol., Abstract: The prevalence of diabetes in West Africa is increasing, posing a major public health threat. An estimated 24 million Africans have diabetes, with rates in West Africa around 2-6% and projected to rise 129% by 2045 according to the WHO. Over 90% of cases are Type 2 diabetes (IDF, World Bank). As diabetes is ambulatory care sensitive, good primary care is crucial to reduce complications and mortality. However, research on factors influencing diabetes primary care access, utilisation and quality in West Africa remains limited despite growing disease burden. While research has emphasised diabetes prevalence and risk factors in West Africa, there remains limited evidence on contextual influences on primary care. This scoping review aims to address these evidence gaps. Using the established methodology by Arksey and O'Malley, this scoping review will undergo six stages. The review will adopt the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Extension for Scoping Review (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines to ensure methodological rigour. We will search four electronic databases and search through grey literature sources to thoroughly explore the topic. The identified articles will undergo thorough screening. We will collect data using a standardised data extraction form that covers study characteristics, population demographics, and study methods. The study will identify key themes and sub-themes related to primary healthcare access, utilisation, and quality. We will then analyse and summarise the data using a narrative synthesis approach. The findings and conclusive report will be finished and sent to a peer-reviewed publication within six months. This review protocol aims to systematically examine and assess the factors that impact the access, utilisation, and standard of primary healthcare services for diabetes in West Africa.\n",

This study or needs assessment, aimed at updating the human and material resources, identifying the gaps and unmet needs for comprehensive diabetes care in Ghana. We conducted a national audit of 122 facilities in all 16 administrative regions of Ghana. Information obtained covered areas on personnel and multidisciplinary teams, access to medications, access to laboratory services, financing, screening services, management of diabetes complications, and availability/use of diabetes guidelines or protocols. Data was analysed using STATA version 16.1. P-values <0.05 were set as significant. Only 85(69.7%) out of the 122 surveyed facilities had a dedicated centre or service for diabetes care. Twenty-eight (23%) had trained diabetes doctors/specialists; and whilst most centres had ophthalmic nurses and dieticians, majority of them did not have trained diabetes educators (nurses), psychologists, ophthalmologists, podiatrists, and foot/vascular surgeons. Also, 13.9% had monofilaments, none could perform urine dipstick for microalbumin; 5 (4.1%) and just over 50% could perform laboratory microalbumin estimation and glycated haemoglobin, respectively. Access to and supply of human insulins was better than analogue insulin in most centres. Nearly 100% of the institutions surveyed had access to metformin and sulphonylurea with good to excellent supply in most cases, whilst access to Sodium Glucose Transporter-2 inhibitors and Glucagon-like peptide-1 analogues were low, and moderate for Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors and thiazolidinediones. Majority of the health facilities (95.1%) offered NHIS as payment mechanism for clients, whilst 68.0% and 30.3% of the patients paid for services using out-of-pocket and private insurance respectively.

            "ID: 38768058, Title: Metabolic dysregulation in obese women and the carcinogenesis of gynecological tumors: A review., Abstract: Obesity is a significant health issue associated with increased cancer risks, including gynecological malignancies. The worldwide rise in obesity rates is significantly impacting both cancer development and treatment outcomes. Adipose tissue plays a crucial role in metabolism, secreting various substances that can influence cancer formation. In obese individuals, dysfunctional adipose tissue can contribute to cancer development through inflammation, insulin resistance, hormonal changes, and abnormal cholesterol metabolism. Studies have shown a strong correlation between obesity and gynecological cancers, particularly endometrial and breast cancers. Obesity not only increases the risk of developing these cancers but is also associated with poorer outcomes. Additionally, obesity affects the perioperative management of gynecological cancers, requiring specialized care due to increased complications and resistance to therapy. Treatment strategies for managing metabolic dysregulation in patients with gynecological cancers include weight management, statin therapy, and insulin-sensitizing medications. Emerging studies suggest that interventions like intermittent fasting and caloric restriction may enhance the effectiveness of cancer treatments. Furthermore, targeting cholesterol metabolism, such as with statins or proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors, shows potential in cancer therapy. In conclusion, addressing metabolic issues, particularly obesity, is crucial in preventing and treating gynecological malignancies. Personalized approaches focusing on weight management and metabolic reprogramming may improve outcomes in these patients.\n",
            "ID: 38768051, Title: Fractures in Patients With Diabetes Mellitus: Findings From a 20-year Registry at a Single Level 1 Trauma Center., Abstract: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a risk factor of infection. Although DM has been associated with worse functional outcomes after acetabular fracture, literature regarding the effect of DM on surgical site infection and other early complications is lacking. A 20-year registry from a level 1 trauma center was queried to identify 134 patients with DM and 345 nondiabetic patients with acetabular fractures. The diabetic patient population was older (57.2 versus 43.2; P < 0.001) and had higher average body mass index (33.6 versus 29.5; P < 0.001). Eighty-three patients with DM and 270 nondiabetics were treated surgically (62% versus 78%; P < 0.001). Diabetic patients who were younger (54.6 versus 61.4; P = 0.01) with fewer comorbidities (1.7 versus 2.2; P = 0.04) were more frequently managed surgically. On univariate analysis, patients with DM more commonly developed any early infection (28.4% versus 21%; P = 0.049) but were no more likely to develop surgical site infection, or other postoperative complications. Older patient age, length of stay, baseline pulmonary disease, and concurrent abdominal injury were independent predictors of postoperative infection other than surgical site infection. Diabetics that developed infection had more comorbidities (2.4 versus 1.5; P < 0.001) and higher Injury Severity Score (24.1 versus 15.8; P = 0.003), and were more frequently insulin-dependent (72.7% versus 41%; P = 0.01). Independent of management strategy, diabetic patients were more likely to develop an infection after acetabular fracture. Insulin dependence was associated with postoperative infection on univariate analysis. Optimal selection of surgical candidates among patients with DM may limit postoperative infections.\n",
            "ID: 38767891, Title: Factors associated to hemoglobin decrease after percutaneous nephrolithotomy: a retrospective study., Abstract: This study aims to determine the preoperative and perioperative risk parameters associated with a decrease in hemoglobin (Hb) in patients undergoing percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL). We collected prospective data of consecutive patients who underwent PCNL from January 2018 to December 2022. The median decrease in post-operative hemoglobin levels compared to pre-operative was found to be 1.5 g/dl. This value was the cut-off value that divided the sample into two groups. Group 1 has a decrease in Hb levels that is higher or equal to the cutoff, group 2 has a decrease in Hb levels that is lower than the cut-off. All preoperative, stone characteristics and perioperative factors were recorded. A total of 273 patients were included in the study, 141 in Group 1 and 132 in Group 2. The mean age of Group 1 was significantly higher (55.48 ± 8.73 vs 45.9 ± 10.75 years, p < 0.05). The mean bleeding of Group 1 was significantly higher (285.85 ± 113.68 vs 135 ± 77.54 ml, p < 0.05). There was a significant difference in mean operation time between groups (86.35 ± 32.05 vs 64.89 ± 27.83 min, p < 0.05). Multivariate analysis showed that the variables age, comorbid diabetes mellitus, intraoperative bleeding amount, and operation time had a significant relationship with Hb reduction in patients undergoing PCNL (p < 0.05). Older age, comorbid diabetes mellitus, large amounts of intraoperative bleeding, and longer operating time are factors associated with PCNL-related postoperative hemoglobin decrease.\n",

RBP3 concentration was measured by custom-developed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in aqueous and correlated with vitreous concentrations in patients from the 50-Year Medalist study and Beetham Eye Institute at Joslin Diabetes Center. Aqueous RBP3 concentration (N = 131) was elevated in eyes with no to mild DR (mean ± SD 0.7 nM ± 0.2) and decreased in eyes with moderate to severe DR (0.65 nM ± 0.3) and proliferative DR (0.5 nM ± 0.2, P < 0.001) compared to eyes without diabetes. Aqueous and vitreous RBP3 concentrations correlated with each other (r = 0.34, P = 0.001) and between fellow eyes (P < 0.0001). History of retinal surgery did not affect aqueous RBP3 concentrations, but cataract surgery affected both vitreous and aqueous levels. Elevated aqueous RBP3 concentration associated with increased thickness of the outer nuclear layer (P = 0.004) and correlated with hemoglobin A1c, whereas vitreous RBP3 concentrations correlated with diabetic systemic complications. These findings suggest that aqueous RBP3 concentration may be an important endogenous clinical retinal protective factor, a biomarker for DR severity, and a promising VEGF-independent clinical intervention target in DR.\n",
            "ID: 38767849, Title: ASSOCIATION OF MACULAR STRUCTURE WITH MICROPERIMETRY SENSITIVITY FOLLOWING VITRECTOMY FOR PROLIFERATE DIABETIC RETINOPATHY., Abstract: To evaluate macular sensitivity using microperimetry in patients with proliferate diabetic retinopathy following vitrectomy and to investigate the relationship between the sensitivity and foveal microstructures with optical coherence tomography/angiography. Eighty-four eyes of 84 patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy, who were indicated for vitrectomy, had no intraocular surgery history 3 months preoperatively, and were able to ensure fundus examination after the vitrectomy, were included. A logMAR best-corrected visual acuity, macular sensitivity of microperimetry, macular retinal thickness, and macular vessel perfusion using optical coherence tomography/angiography were examined at 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months postoperatively. The logMAR best-corrected visual acuity and mean macular sensitivity of patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy improved postoperatively (P < 0.05). There was a significant correlation between best-corrected visual acuity and mean sensitivity (P < 0.05). Postoperative mean macular sensitivity was significantly correlated with outer retinal thickness in the 0 to 6 mm macular area (P < 0.05) and also significantly correlated with deep capillary plexus perfusion (P < 0.05). Fixation stability and mean macular sensitivity did not show any correlation with glycated hemoglobin, triglyceride, serum total cholesterol, carbamide, and creatinine and duration of diabetes mellitus (P > 0.05). Postoperative mean macular sensitivity was significantly correlated with outer retinal thickness and deep capillary plexus perfusion for patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy. The authors found that the visual performance of patients can be evaluated by the outer retinal thickness and deep capillary plexus perfusion, so optical coherence tomography/angiography examination can be an important prognostic factor for visual performance in patients.Clinical Trial Registration: This trial is registered with the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (http://www.chictr.org.cn; Registration No.: ChiCTR2100043399).\n",
            "ID: 38767826, Title: Dietary Modulations in Preventing Cardiometabolic Risk in Individuals with Type 2 Diabetes., Abstract: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a complex health issue include obesity, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and chronic inflammation that increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). CVDs are of great concern in the disease progression and prognosis of T2DM. This review is a comprehensive examination of the literature on the relationship between T2DM and cardiovascular risk, nutrition-related cardiometabolic risk (CMR) factors, and impact of dietary modulations on CMR. In recent years the researches has been focus on the importance of a comprehensive treatment approach like dietary modulations to address multiple cardiovascular risk reductions, including hypertension and dyslipidemia. Modulation of dietary patterns are the most promising interventions to prevent CMR factors and T2DM via affecting the body weight, glucose control, and microbial diversity of individuals. Current evidence suggests that high-quality dietary patterns such as the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan and the Mediterranean diet is important in the metabolic control processes of T2DM with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant compounds, glucagon-like peptide agonist compounds, and intestinal microbiota changes. Nutrition plays a critical role in preventing and improving CVD outcomes in patients with T2DM. Dietary modulations should be planned considering individual differences in responses to dietary composition and nutritional changes, personal preferences, eating behaviors and gut microbiota differences.\n",
            "ID: 38767746, Title: Food Insecurity and Hypoglycemia among Older Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Treated with Insulin or Sulfonylureas: The Diabetes & Aging Study., Abstract: Severe hypoglycemia is a serious adverse drug event associated with hypoglycemia-prone medications; older patients with diabetes are particularly at high risk. Economic food insecurity (food insecurity due to financial limitations) is a known risk factor for hypoglycemia; however, less is known about physical food insecurity (due to difficulty cooking or shopping for food), which may increase with age, and its association with hypoglycemia. Study associations between food insecurity and severe hypoglycemia. Survey based cross-sectional study. Survey responses were collected in 2019 from 1,164 older (≥ 65 years) patients with type 2 diabetes treated with insulin or sulfonylureas. Risk ratios (RR) for economic and physical food insecurity associated with self-reported severe hypoglycemia (low blood glucose requiring assistance) adjusted for age, financial strain, HbA1c, Charlson comorbidity score and frailty. Self-reported reasons for hypoglycemia endorsed by respondents. Food insecurity was reported by 12.3% of the respondents; of whom 38.4% reported economic food insecurity only, 21.1% physical food insecurity only and 40.5% both. Economic food insecurity and physical food insecurity were strongly associated with severe hypoglycemia (RR = 4.3; p = 0.02 and RR = 4.4; p = 0.002, respectively). Missed meals (\"skipped meals, not eating enough or waiting too long to eat\") was the dominant reason (77.5%) given for hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia prevention efforts among older patients with diabetes using hypoglycemia-prone medications should address food insecurity. Standard food insecurity questions, which are used to identify economic food insecurity, will fail to identify patients who have physical food insecurity only.\n",
            "ID: 38767740, Title: Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease and Ethnicity: Lessons Learned from the Arab Population in Israel., Abstract: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common liver disease. We aimed to investigate the potential similarities and differences regarding the disease among Arabs and Jews. Retrospective study included all patients older than 18 years with NAFLD diagnosis according to ICD-10 codes. Data regarding demographics, comorbidities, and outcomes were retrieved using the MdClone platform from \"Clalit\" in Israel. Data concerning 34,090 Arab patients and 173,500 Jewish patients with NAFLD were included. Arab patients were significantly younger at diagnosis (35.0 ± 13 years vs. 43.6 ± 15 years, p < 0.001) and had higher rates of obesity and diabetes mellitus (69.5% vs. 56.5% and 27.0% vs. 22.7%, p < 0.001, respectively). Arab patients had higher rates of cirrhosis and portal hypertension-related complications (2.5% vs. 2.0%, p < 0.001), esophageal varices (0.9% vs. 0.5%, p < 0.001), spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (0.3% vs. 0.1%, p < 0.001), and hepatorenal syndrome (0.3% vs. 0.1%, p < 0.001). There was no significant difference in the prevalence of hepatocellular carcinoma between study groups (0.4% vs. 0.5%, p = 0.156). Liver transplantation was performed in 0.2% of Arab NAFLD patients compared to 0.07% of Jewish NAFLD patients (p < 0.001). Lower rates of all-cause mortality were found among the Arab NAFLD patients versus Jewish NAFLD patients (7.7% versus 11.5%, p < 0.001). According to the Cox regression model, Arab ethnicity is a risk factor for death with OR of 1.36. Significant differences regarding comorbidities, complications, liver transplantations rates, and all-cause mortality were found among NAFLD patients of different ethnicities, hence specific population need specific consideration in prevention, early diagnosis and follow up.\n",
            "ID: 38767687, Title: High body mass index and triglyceride levels at health checkups increase the risk of new-onset chronic kidney disease and worsening renal function: the TAMA MED Project-CKD., Abstract: Health checkups are important in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), which is not easily accompanied by subjective symptoms. CKD can be caused or aggravated by factors that have not yet been identified. This retrospective cohort study included 7 483 patients who underwent specific annual health checkups at a medical institution in Tama City, did not have CKD in 2012, and continued to undergo checkups (aged 40-74 years). We examined the risk factors for new-onset CKD and 1.5-fold increase in serum creatinine levels among laboratory values from 2012 to 2020. Age, body mass index (BMI), triglyceride levels, atrial fibrillation, and medication for hypertension (HT) and diabetes mellitus were independent risk factors for proteinuria, whereas current smoking, BMI, systolic blood pressure (SBP), and medication for HT were independent risk factors for estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>. SBP, triglyceride levels and medication for HT were risk factors for a 1.5-fold increase in serum creatinine levels during course of the study. The cut-off values of BMI for eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> were 22.2 (men 24.7, women 22.1) kg/m<sup>2</sup> and fasting triglyceride levels for a 1.5-fold increase in serum creatinine level were 171 (men 247, women 170) mg/dL, respectively. Health checkups provide information to prevent new-onset CKD and worsening of renal function. It is necessary to increase the rate of health checkups and visits to medical institutions after health checkups as well as to use these results for health guidance.\n",
            "ID: 38767675, Title: Open questions on basal insulin therapy in T2D: a Delphi consensus., Abstract: The revolution in the therapeutic approach to type 2 diabetes (T2D) requires a rethinking of the positioning of basal insulin (BI) therapy. Given the considerable number of open questions, a group of experts was convened with the aim of providing, through a Delphi consensus method, practical guidance for doctors. A group of 6 experts developed a series of 29 statements on: the role of metabolic control in light of the most recent guidelines; BI intensification strategies: (1) add-on versus switch; (2) inertia in starting and titrating; (3) free versus fixed ratio combination; basal-bolus intensification and de-intensification strategies; second generation analogues of BI (2BI). A panel of 31 diabetologists, by accessing a dedicated website, assigned each statement a relevance score on a 9-point scale. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method was adopted to assess the existence of disagreement among participants. Panelists showed agreement for all 29 statements, of which 26 were considered relevant, one was considered not relevant and two were of uncertain relevance. Panelists agreed that the availability of new classes of drugs often allows the postponement of BI and the simplification of therapy. It remains essential to promptly initiate and titrate BI when required. BI should always, unless contraindicated, be started in addition to, and not as a replacement, for ongoing treatments with cardiorenal benefits. 2BIs should be preferred for their pharmacological profile, greater ease of self-titration and flexibility of administration. In a continuously evolving scenario, BI therapy still represents an important option in the management of T2D patients.\n",
            "ID: 38767674, Title: Assessment of genetic and clinical factors in T2D susceptibility among patients with hypertension., Abstract: Hypertension (HTN) and Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) often coexist, therefore understanding the relationship between both diseases is imperative to guide targeted prevention/therapy. This study aims to explore the relationship between HTN and T2D using genome-wide association study (GWAS) analysis and biochemical data to understand the implication of both clinical and genetic factors in these pathologies. A total of 2,876 patients were enrolled. Using GWAS and biochemical data, patients with both T2D and HTN were compared to patients with only HTN. Specificity was confirmed by testing the detected genetic variants for associations with HTN development in T2D patients, or with HTN in healthy subjects. Regression models were applied to examine the association of T2D in patients with HTN with cardiovascular risk factors. Replication was performed using UK Biobank dataset with 31,170 subjects. Data showed that females with HTN are at higher risk of developing T2D due to dyslipidemia, while males faced higher risk due to high BMI (body mass index) and family history of T2D. GWAS identified Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) linked to T2D in patients with HTN. Notably, rs7865889, rs7756992, and rs10896290 were positively associated with T2D, whereas rs12737517 yielded negative association. Three SNPs were replicated in the UK Biobank (rs10896290, rs7865889, and rs7756992). Incorporating clinical and genetic screening into risk assessment is important for the detection and prevention of T2D in patients with HTN. The detected SNPs (rs7865889, rs12737517, and rs10896290), especially the protective SNP (rs12737517), provide an opportunity for better diagnosis, prevention, and therapy of patients with T2D and HTN.\n",

We searched eight databases along with five international and national organizations to develop or archive guidelines from their inception to July 2023, with an additional search of medlive.cn. And the authoritative organizations related to nephrology. CPGs and consensus statements created using direct differential diagnosis or therapy for DKD were included without language restrictions. Their quality was evaluated by four reviewers using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation Ⅱ (AGREE Ⅱ) instrument. Along with the item and domain scores, the guideline was also allocated an overall quality score, which ranged from 1 (lowest possible quality) to 7 (highest possible quality). Moreover, an overall recommendation for use was also assigned (\"recommended\", \"recommended with modifications\" or \"not recommended\"). A total of 16 CPGs were included, of which 14 were from Asia and the remaining two from Europe. These two CPGs were updated in the third version. Six CPGs were recommended for use because their primary domains scored in the medium or high category. Furthermore, five CPGs were recommended with modifications as the stakeholder involvement, applicability, and editorial independence domains were evaluated as low categories. In all domains, the lowest average score was for rigour of development (33%), followed by application (36%), and stakeholder involvement (51%). The highest average score was for scope and purpose (79%), followed by clarity of presentation (75%). None of the CPGs considered the patient's viewpoint, and six of 16 CPGs did not use any grading system to translate the evidence into recommendations. Additionally, only three of 16 CPGs shared search strategy, and eight of 16 CPGs did not declare a funding source. According to the AGREE II evaluation, more than one in four CPGs for DKD had poor methodological quality. Enhanced efforts are needed to advance the rigour of development, application, and editorial independence of DKD guideline panels for most guidelines. Stakeholders, CPG developers, and CPG users should consider methodological quality while choosing CPGs, and interpret and implement their issued suggestions.\n",

We enrolled 435 patients with DKD, who were not undergoing dialysis, admitted to the Department of Nephrology, First Medical Center, Chinese PLA General Hospital from April 2020 to August 2021. Analysis of their TCM syndromes and related factors was carried out. The 435 patients included 109, 117, 86, and 123 chronic kidney disease (CKD) 1-2, CKD3, CKD4, and CKD5 cases, respectively. With the progression of CKD1-5, the proportion of <i>Yin</i> deficiency and dry heat syndrome, and that of <i>Qi</i> and <i>Yin</i> deficiency syndrome showed a downward trend, whereas the proportion of spleen-kidney <i>Yang</i> deficiency, blood deficiency, blood stasis, water stagnation, and phlegm turbidity syndromes showed an upward trend; the differences were statistically significant (<i>P</i> < 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that <i>Yin</i> deficiency and dry heat syndrome was positively correlated with hemoglobin [odds ratio (<i>OR</i>) = 1.022, <i>P</i> = 0.005], albumin (<i>OR</i> = 1.058, <i>P =</i> 0.006), and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (<i>OR</i> = 1.020, <i>P <</i> 0.001) but negatively correlated with male sex (<i>OR</i> = 0.277, <i>P =</i> 0.004). <i>Qi</i> and <i>Yin</i> deficiency syndrome was positively correlated with albumin (<i>OR</i> = 1.056, <i>P</i> < 0.001) and eGFR (<i>OR</i> = 1.008, <i>P</i> = 0.022) but negatively correlated with age (<i>OR</i> = 0.977, <i>P</i> = 0.023). Liver-kidney <i>Yin</i> deficiency syndrome was positively correlated with age (<i>OR</i> = 1.028, <i>P =</i> 0.021) and glycosylated hemoglobin (<i>OR</i> = 1.223, <i>P =</i> 0.007) but negatively correlated with total cholesterol (<i>OR</i> = 0.792, <i>P</i> = 0.006).

            "ID: 38767572, Title: Proteasome gene expression is controlled by coordinated functions of multiple transcription factors., Abstract: Proteasome activity is crucial for cellular integrity, but how tissues adjust proteasome content in response to catabolic stimuli is uncertain. Here, we demonstrate that transcriptional coordination by multiple transcription factors is required to increase proteasome content and activate proteolysis in catabolic states. Using denervated mouse muscle as a model system for accelerated proteolysis in vivo, we reveal that a two-phase transcriptional program activates genes encoding proteasome subunits and assembly chaperones to boost an increase in proteasome content. Initially, gene induction is necessary to maintain basal proteasome levels, and in a more delayed phase (7-10 days after denervation), it stimulates proteasome assembly to meet cellular demand for excessive proteolysis. Intriguingly, the transcription factors PAX4 and α-PALNRF-1 control the expression of proteasome among other genes in a combinatorial manner, driving cellular adaptation to muscle denervation. Consequently, PAX4 and α-PALNRF-1 represent new therapeutic targets to inhibit proteolysis in catabolic diseases (e.g., type-2 diabetes, cancer).\n",

In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the 12-month clinical outcomes of Ultimaster™ stents in Korean patients with coronary artery disease. This study is a multicenter, prospective, observational registry across 12 hospitals. To reflect real-world clinical evidence, non-selective subtypes of patients and lesions were included in this study. The study end point was target lesion failure (TLF) (the composite of cardiac death, target vessel myocardial infarction [MI], and target lesion revascularization [TLR]) at 12-month clinical follow up. A total of 576 patients were enrolled between November 2016 and May 2021. Most of the patients were male (76.5%), with a mean age of 66.0±11.2 years. Among the included patients, 40.1% had diabetes mellitus (DM) and 67.9% had acute coronary syndrome (ACS). At 12 months, the incidence of TLF was 4.1%. The incidence of cardiac death was 1.5%, MI was 1.0%, TLR was 2.7%, and stent thrombosis was 0.6%. In subgroup analysis based on the presence of ACS, DM, hypertension, dyslipidemia, or bifurcation, there were no major differences in the incidence of the primary endpoint. The present registry shows that Ultimaster™ stent is safe and effective for routine real-world clinical practice in non-selective Korean patients, having a low rate of adverse events at least up to 12 months.\n",
            "ID: 38767438, Title: Augmenter of liver regeneration knockout aggravates tubular ferroptosis and macrophage activation by regulating carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1A-induced lipid metabolism in diabetic nephropathy., Abstract: Ferroptosis is a novel type of programmed cell death that performs a critical function in diabetic nephropathy (DN). Augmenter of liver regeneration (ALR) exists in the inner membrane of mitochondria, and inhibits inflammation, apoptosis, and oxidative stress in acute kidney injury; however, its role in DN remains unexplored. Here, we aimed to identify the role of ALR in ferroptosis induction and macrophage activation in DN. The expression of ALR was examined in DN patients, db/db DN mice, and HK-2 cells treated with high glucose (HG). The effects of ALR on ferroptosis and macrophage activation were investigated with ALR conditional knockout, lentivirus transfection, transmission electron microscopy, qRT-PCR and western blotting assay. Mass spectrometry and rescue experiments were conducted to determine the mechanism of ALR. ALR expression was reduced in the kidney tissues of DN patients and mice, serum of DN patients, and HG-HK-2 cells. Moreover, the inhibition of ALR promoted ferroptosis, macrophage activation, and DN progression. Mechanistically, ALR can directly bind to carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1A (CPT1A), the key rate-limiting enzyme of fatty acid oxidation (FAO), and inhibit the expression of CPT1A to regulate lipid metabolism involving FAO and lipid droplet-mitochondrial coupling in DN. Taken together, our findings revealed a crucial protective role of ALR in ferroptosis induction and macrophage activation in DN and identified it as an alternative diagnostic marker and therapeutic target for DN.\n",
            "ID: 38767382, Title: Building Trustworthy Generative Artificial Intelligence for Diabetes Care and Limb Preservation: A Medical Knowledge Extraction Case., Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer significant potential in medical information extraction but carry risks of generating incorrect information. This study aims to develop and validate a retriever-augmented generation (RAG) model that provides accurate medical knowledge about diabetes and diabetic foot care to laypersons with an eighth-grade literacy level. Improving health literacy through patient education is paramount to addressing the problem of limb loss in the diabetic population. In addition to affecting patient well-being through improved outcomes, improved physician well-being is an important outcome of a self-management model for patient health education. We used an RAG architecture and built a question-and-answer artificial intelligence (AI) model to extract knowledge in response to questions pertaining to diabetes and diabetic foot care. We utilized GPT-4 by OpenAI, with Pinecone as a vector database. The NIH National Standards for Diabetes Self-Management Education served as the basis for our knowledge base. The model's outputs were validated through expert review against established guidelines and literature. Fifty-eight keywords were used to select 295 articles and the model was tested against 175 questions across topics. The study demonstrated that with appropriate content volume and few-shot learning prompts, the RAG model achieved 98% accuracy, confirming its capability to offer user-friendly and comprehensible medical information. The RAG model represents a promising tool for delivering reliable medical knowledge to the public which can be used for self-education and self-management for diabetes, highlighting the importance of content validation and innovative prompt engineering in AI applications.\n",
            "ID: 38767365, Title: Isolation of Nuclei from Human Intermuscular Adipose Tissue and Downstream Single-Nuclei RNA Sequencing., Abstract: Intermuscular adipose tissue (IMAT) is a relatively understudied adipose depot located between muscle fibers. IMAT content increases with age and BMI and is associated with metabolic and muscle degenerative diseases; however, an understanding of the biological properties of IMAT and its interplay with the surrounding muscle fibers is severely lacking. In recent years, single-cell and nuclei RNA sequencing have provided us with cell type-specific atlases of several human tissues. However, the cellular composition of human IMAT remains largely unexplored due to the inherent challenges of its accessibility from biopsy collection in humans. In addition to the limited amount of tissue collected, the processing of human IMAT is complicated due to its proximity to skeletal muscle tissue and fascia. The lipid-laden nature of the adipocytes makes it incompatible with single-cell isolation. Hence, single nuclei RNA sequencing is optimal for obtaining high-dimensional transcriptomics at single-cell resolution and provides the potential to uncover the biology of this depot, including the exact cellular composition of IMAT. Here, we present a detailed protocol for nuclei isolation and library preparation of frozen human IMAT for single nuclei RNA sequencing. This protocol allows for the profiling of thousands of nuclei using a droplet-based approach, thus providing the capacity to detect rare and low-abundant cell types.\n",
            "ID: 38767350, Title: Changes in the type 2 diabetes gut mycobiome associate with metformin treatment across populations., Abstract: The human gut teems with a diverse ecosystem of microbes, yet non-bacterial portions of that community are overlooked in studies of metabolic diseases firmly linked to gut bacteria. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) is associated with compositional shifts in the gut bacterial microbiome and the mycobiome, the fungal portion of the microbiome. However, whether T2D and/or metformin treatment underpins fungal community changes is unresolved. To differentiate these effects, we curated a gut mycobiome cohort spanning 1,000 human samples across five countries and validated our findings in a murine experimental model. We use Bayesian multinomial logistic normal models to show that T2D and metformin both associate with shifts in the relative abundance of distinct gut fungi. T2D is associated with shifts in the Saccharomycetes and Sordariomycetes fungal classes, while the genera <i>Fusarium</i> and <i>Tetrapisipora</i> most consistently associate with metformin treatment. We confirmed the impact of metformin on individual gut fungi by administering metformin to healthy mice. Thus, metformin and T2D account for subtle, but significant and distinct variation in the gut mycobiome across human populations. This work highlights for the first time that metformin can confound associations of gut fungi with T2D and warrants the need to consider pharmaceutical interventions in investigations of linkages between metabolic diseases and gut microbial inhabitants. This is the largest to-date multi-country cohort characterizing the human gut mycobiome, and the first to investigate potential perturbations in gut fungi from oral pharmaceutical treatment. We demonstrate the reproducible effects of metformin treatment on the human and murine gut mycobiome and highlight a need to consider metformin as a confounding factor in investigations between type 2 diabetes mellitus and the gut microbial ecosystem.\n",
            "ID: 38767331, Title: Decoding the complexity of delayed wound healing following <i>Enterococcus faecalis</i> infection., Abstract: Wound infections are highly prevalent and can lead to delayed or failed healing, causing significant morbidity and adverse economic impacts. These infections occur in various contexts, including diabetic foot ulcers, burns, and surgical sites. <i>Enterococcus faecalis</i> is often found in persistent non-healing wounds, but its contribution to chronic wounds remains understudied. To address this, we employed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on infected wounds in comparison to uninfected wounds in a mouse model. Examining over 23,000 cells, we created a comprehensive single-cell atlas that captures the cellular and transcriptomic landscape of these wounds. Our analysis revealed unique transcriptional and metabolic alterations in infected wounds, elucidating the distinct molecular changes associated with bacterial infection compared to the normal wound healing process. We identified dysregulated keratinocyte and fibroblast transcriptomes in response to infection, jointly contributing to an anti-inflammatory environment. Notably, <i>E. faecalis</i> infection prompted a premature, incomplete epithelial-mesenchymal transition in keratinocytes. Additionally, <i>E. faecalis</i> infection modulated M2-like macrophage polarization by inhibiting pro-inflammatory resolution in vitro, in vivo, and in our scRNA-seq atlas. Furthermore, we discovered macrophage crosstalk with neutrophils, which regulates chemokine signaling pathways, while promoting anti-inflammatory interactions with endothelial cells. Overall, our findings offer new insights into the immunosuppressive role of <i>E. faecalis</i> in wound infections.\n",

Mobile health (mHealth)-based lifestyle interventions have been shown to be effective in improving glycemic control of these women. The aim of the study was to evaluate the influence of mHealth-based lifestyle interventions on symptoms of anxiety and depression in women with GDM. A systematic review and meta-analysis or randomized controlled trials. Clinical or community-based settings. Nine studies involving 1,168 pregnant women with GDM were included. mHealth-based lifestyle interventions. Symptoms of anxiety and depression quantitatively analyzed in clinical scales. A systematic literature search was performed in electronic databases, including PubMed, Cochrane library, Embase, Web of Science, Wanfang, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure to obtain relevant randomized controlled studies. A random-effects model was used to pool the results by incorporating the impact of the potential heterogeneity. Findings revealed that when compared to usual care, women who received mHealth-based lifestyle interventions had significant improvements in symptoms of anxiety (standardized mean difference [SMD]: -0.55, 95% CI [-0.77, -0.33], <i>p</i> < .001; <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 67%) and depression (SMD: -0.51, [-0.72, -0.29], <i>p</i> < .001; <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 65%). Sensitivity analyses by excluding one study at a time showed consistent results. Subgroup analyses showed similar results in mHealth achieved by phone, websites, and applications, in mHealth targeting diet and exercise with and without psychological support, in mHealth lead by nurse with and without other clinical specialists, and in studies with different evaluating tools for anxiety and depression. mHealth-based lifestyle interventions could significantly improve the symptoms of anxiety and depression in women with GDM.\n",
            "ID: 38767210, Title: T cells in obesity-associated inflammation: The devil is in the details., Abstract: Obesity presents a significant health challenge, affecting 41% of adults and 19.7% of children in the United States. One of the associated health challenges of obesity is chronic low-grade inflammation. In both mice and humans, T cells in circulation and in the adipose tissue play a pivotal role in obesity-associated inflammation. Changes in the numbers and frequency of specific CD4<sup>+</sup> Th subsets and their contribution to inflammation through cytokine production indicate declining metabolic health, that is, insulin resistance and T2D. While some Th subset alterations are consistent between mice and humans with obesity, some changes mainly characterize male mice, whereas female mice often resist obesity and inflammation. However, protection from obesity and inflammation is not observed in human females, who can develop obesity-related T-cell inflammation akin to males. The decline in female sex hormones after menopause is also implicated in promoting obesity and inflammation. Age is a second underappreciated factor for defining and regulating obesity-associated inflammation toward translating basic science findings to the clinic. Weight loss in mice and humans, in parallel with these other factors, does not resolve obesity-associated inflammation. Instead, inflammation persists amid modest changes in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell frequencies, highlighting the need for further research into resolving changes in T-cell function after weight loss. How lingering inflammation after weight loss affecting the common struggle to maintain lower weight is unknown. Semaglutide, a newly popular pharmaceutical used for treating T2D and reversing obesity, holds promise for alleviating obesity-associated health complications, yet its impact on T-cell-mediated inflammation remains unexplored. Further work in this area could significantly contribute to the scientific understanding of the impacts of weight loss and sex/hormones in obesity and obesity-associated metabolic decline.\n",

            "ID: 38767133, Title: Lipoprotein (a) concentration as a risk factor for ischaemic stroke and its subtypes., Abstract: To investigate the relationship between serum lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)] concentration and the risk of ischaemic stroke (IS) and its subtypes. Lp(a) plays a role in atherogenic, pro-thrombotic, and antifibrinolytic processes. Elevated plasma Lp(a) is a strong independent risk factor for the development and progression of atherosclerotic disease. The association between lipoproteins and IS is more complex than that reported for cardiovascular diseases, with inconsistent and contradictory results from epidemiological studies. 231 patients with acute IS (defined as cases) and 163 age- and sex-matched control subjects were included in this prospective case-control study. Demographic and clinical variables (i.e. age, sex, smoking, presence of chronic diseases and concomitant medication) and laboratory data (i.e. concentrations of total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, triglycerides, Lp(a), apolipoprotein A1, apolipoprotein B) were recorded. The mean age and the percentage of men did not significantly differ between groups. Compared to controls, there was a significantly higher percentage of cases reported with concomitant diseases: diabetes mellitus, myocardial infarction, ischaemic heart disease, peripheral arterial disease, and atrial fibrillation. The study showed a significantly higher serum Lp(a) concentration in cases than in control subjects (81.81 nmol/L [c.32.7 mg/dL] vs. 59.75 nmol/L [c.23.9 mg/dL]; p = 0.036) and found an association between Lp(a) levels stratified by quartiles and the risk for ischaemic stroke (Q1 [Lp(a) < 13 nmol/L] vs. Q4 [Lp(a) > 117 nmol/L]: OR 2.23; 95% CI 1.23-4.03; p = 0.008). A subgroup analysis based on the TOAST classification of IS also showed a significant association between Lp(a) value of more than 75 nmol/L (30 mg/dL) and the risk of large-artery atherosclerosis stroke compared to the controls (OR 2.4; 95% CI 1.39-3.93; p = 0.001), as well as a statistically non-significant association with other subtypes of IS. The influence of Lp(a) remained significant even after adjusting for established risk factors for IS (OR 1.99; 95% CI 1.05-3.76; p = 0.04; respectively for the large-artery atherosclerotic subtype: OR 2.54; 95% CI 1.39-4.67; p = 0.003). We found that Lp(a) is an independent risk factor for ischaemic stroke, and for the large-artery atherosclerotic subtype of ischaemic stroke.\n",
            "ID: 38767130, Title: Immediate response to intravitreal treatment for macular edema due to diabetes and retinal vein occlusion., Abstract: To objectively assess the immediate response to intravitreal treatment for macular edema and compare it across different agents. This retrospective, comparative study included patients with macular edema due to diabetic retinopathy (DME) or vein occlusion who were treated with intravitreal injections of either steroids (triamcinolone acetonide or dexamethasone sustained release implant) or anti-vascular endothelial growth factor antibodies (VEGF). The central retinal thickness (CRT) and the best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) were measured 1 day after the injection and compared with immediate pre-injection values. There were 79 eyes (57 patients) including 51 eyes with DME, 18 with branch retinal vein occlusion edema (BRVO-ME), and 10 eyes with central retinal vein occlusion edema (CRVO-ME). The intravitreal agents were triamcinolone acetonide (TA)(<i>n</i> = 15), dexamethasone sustained release implant (DEX)(<i>n</i> = 22), ranibizumab (<i>n</i> = 19), and bevacizumab (<i>n</i> = 23). Statistically significant improvement in CRT was seen in all injection groups (<i>p</i> < 0.05) while improvement in mean BCVA was significant only in the TA group (<i>p</i> = 0.009). The mean change in CRT was maximum with steroids than with anti-VEGFs; viz. 159.47 µ in TA, 115.45 µ in DEX, 86.10 µ in ranibizumab, and 78.78 µ in bevacizumab group. Least amount of change was noted in the spongy type of macular edema (18.73 µ) while improvement in mean BCVA was statistically significant only in the cystoid group (<i>p</i> = 0.01). Comparatively, steroid agents showed better immediate response to therapy than anti-VEGFs. Maximum reduction in central retinal thickness was seen following triamcinolone acetonide injection. Cystoid edema showed better immediate response than spongy retinal thickening.\n",
            "ID: 38767128, Title: Severe dawn phenomenon predicts long-term risk of all-cause mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes., Abstract: The dawn phenomenon (DP) is an abnormal early morning blood glucose rise without nocturnal hypoglycaemia, which can be more easily and precisely assessed with continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). This prospective study aimed to explore the association between DP and the risk of all-cause mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes. A total of 5542 adult inpatients with type 2 diabetes in a single centre were analysed. The magnitude of DP (ΔG) was defined as the increment in the CGM-determined glucose value from nocturnal nadir (after 24:00) to prebreakfast. Participants were stratified into four groups by ΔG: ≤1.11, 1.12-3.33, 3.34-5.55, and >5.55 mmol/L. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to evaluate the impact of DP on all-cause mortality risk. During a median follow-up of 9.4 years, 1083 deaths were identified. The restricted cubic spline revealed a nonlinear (p for nonlinearity = 0.002) relationship between ΔG and the risk of all-cause mortality. A multivariate-adjusted Cox regression model including glycated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) showed that ΔG > 5.55 mmol/L was associated with 30% (95% CI, 1.01-1.66) higher risk of all-cause mortality, as compared with ΔG 1.12-3.33 mmol/L. Higher ΔG is significantly related to an increased risk of all-cause mortality in type 2 diabetes, suggesting that severe DP should be given more attention as a part of glucose management to reduce the risk of long-term adverse outcomes.\n",
            "ID: 38767115, Title: Genetic Associations with C-peptide Levels before Type 1 Diabetes Diagnosis in At-Risk Relatives., Abstract: We sought to determine whether the type 1 diabetes genetic risk score-2 (T1D-GRS2) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are associated with C-peptide preservation before type 1 diabetes diagnosis. We conducted a retrospective analysis of 713 autoantibody-positive participants who developed type 1 diabetes in the TrialNet Pathway to Prevention Study who had T1DExomeChip data. We evaluated the relationships of 16 known SNPs and T1D-GRS2 with area under the curve (AUC) C-peptide levels during oral glucose tolerance tests conducted in the 9 months before diagnosis. Higher T1D-GRS2 was associated with lower C-peptide AUC in the 9 months before diagnosis in univariate (β=-0.06, P<0.0001) and multivariate (β=-0.03, P=0.005) analyses. Participants with the JAZF1 rs864745 T allele had lower C-peptide AUC in both univariate (β=-0.11, P=0.002) and multivariate (β=-0.06, P=0.018) analyses. The type 2 diabetes-associated JAZF1 rs864745 T allele and higher T1D-GRS2 are associated with lower C-peptide AUC prior to diagnosis of type 1 diabetes, with implications for the design of prevention trials.\n",
            "ID: 38767114, Title: Androgens Modulate the Immune Profile in a Mouse Model of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome., Abstract: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is associated with a low-grade inflammation, but it is unknown how hyperandrogenism, the hallmark of PCOS, affects the immune system. Using a PCOS-like mouse model, it is demonstrated that hyperandrogenism affects immune cell populations in reproductive, metabolic, and immunological tissues differently in a site-specific manner. Co-treatment with an androgen receptor antagonist prevents most of these alterations, demonstrating that these effects are mediated through androgen receptor activation. Dihydrotestosterone (DHT)-exposed mice displayed a drastically reduced eosinophil population in the uterus and visceral adipose tissue (VAT). A higher frequency of natural killer (NK) cells and elevated levels of IFN-γ and TNF-α are seen in uteri of androgen-exposed mice, while NK cells in VAT and spleen displayed a higher expression level of CD69, a marker of activation or tissue residency. Distinct alterations of macrophages in the uterus, ovaries, and VAT are also found in DHT-exposed mice and can potentially be linked to PCOS-like traits of the model. Indeed, androgen-exposed mice are insulin-resistant, albeit unaltered fat mass. Collectively, it is demonstrated that hyperandrogenism causes tissue-specific alterations of immune cells in reproductive organs and VAT, which can have considerable implications on tissue function and contribute to the reduced fertility and metabolic comorbidities associated with PCOS.\n",

Its effectiveness and tolerability as an addition to metformin, DPP4 inhibitor and insulin treatment in type 2 diabetic patients will be examined in this research. Participants with type 2 diabetes from poor socio-economic backgrounds had HbA1c values ≥8.5% when using Insulin+Metformin+DPP-4 inhibitors. They received 10mg Empagliflozin daily for 12 weeks (n=143). The main outcome was change in HbA1c at 12<sup>th</sup> week from baseline. Secondary outcomes were baseline weight and week 12 FPG. Adjusted mean (SE) HbA1c increases at week 12 were: Mean ± SD 10.38 (6.8-17.0) vs. Mean±SD 9.05±1.77 (5.60-16.0) with empagliflozin 10mg. When added to the regimen, empagliflozin significantly reduced FPG, systolic and diastolic blood pressure. The mean (SE) BMI increases from baseline were 31.28±5.89 (16.0-66.0) and 29.73±5.47 (3.0-46.0) with 10mg empagliflozin. Two individuals experienced urinary tract infections as AEs, but no genital infections. Adding empagliflozin 10mg daily to metformin+DPP4 inhibitor+insulin improved glycemic control, body weight and blood pressure for 12 weeks. The intervention was well-tolerated, highlighting empagliflozin's therapeutic potential.\n"
