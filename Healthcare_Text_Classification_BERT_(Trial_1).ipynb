            "ID: 38763677, Title: Anti-obesity and anti-diabetic bioactive peptides: A comprehensive review of their sources, properties, and techno-functional challenges., Abstract: The scourge of obesity arising from obesogens and poor dieting still ravages our planet as half of the global population may be overweight and obese by 2035. This metabolic disorder is intertwined with type 2 diabetes (T2D), both of which warrant alternative therapeutic options other than clinically approved drugs like orlistat with their tendency of abuse and side effects. In this review, we comprehensively describe the global obesity problem and its connection to T2D. Obesity, overconsumption of fats, the mechanism of fat digestion, obesogenic gut microbiota, inhibition of fat digestion, and natural anti-obesity compounds are discussed. Similar discussions are made for diabetes with regard to glucose regulation, the diabetic gut microbiota, and insulinotropic compounds. The sources and production of anti-obesity bioactive peptides (AOBPs) and anti-diabetic bioactive peptides (ADBPs) are also described while explaining their structure-function relationships, gastrointestinal behaviors, and action mechanisms. Finally, the techno-functional applications of AOBPs and ADBPs are highlighted.\n",
            "ID: 38763510, Title: Efficacy and Safety of Metformin and Atorvastatin Combination Therapy vs. Monotherapy with Either Drug in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Dyslipidemia Patients (ATOMIC): Double-Blinded Randomized Controlled Trial., Abstract: It is well known that a large number of patients with diabetes also have dyslipidemia, which significantly increases the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of combination drugs consisting of metformin and atorvastatin, widely used as therapeutic agents for diabetes and dyslipidemia. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group and phase III multicenter study included adults with glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels >7.0% and <10.0%, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) >100 and <250 mg/dL. One hundred eighty-five eligible subjects were randomized to the combination group (metformin+atorvastatin), metformin group (metformin+atorvastatin placebo), and atorvastatin group (atorvastatin+metformin placebo). The primary efficacy endpoints were the percent changes in HbA1c and LDL-C levels from baseline at the end of the treatment. After 16 weeks of treatment compared to baseline, HbA1c showed a significant difference of 0.94% compared to the atorvastatin group in the combination group (0.35% vs. -0.58%, respectively; P<0.0001), whereas the proportion of patients with increased HbA1c was also 62% and 15%, respectively, showing a significant difference (P<0.001). The combination group also showed a significant decrease in LDL-C levels compared to the metformin group (-55.20% vs. -7.69%, P<0.001) without previously unknown adverse drug events. The addition of atorvastatin to metformin improved HbA1c and LDL-C levels to a significant extent compared to metformin or atorvastatin alone in diabetes and dyslipidemia patients. This study also suggested metformin's preventive effect on the glucose-elevating potential of atorvastatin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and dyslipidemia, insufficiently controlled with exercise and diet. Metformin and atorvastatin combination might be an effective treatment in reducing the CVD risk in patients with both diabetes and dyslipidemia because of its lowering effect on LDL-C and glucose.\n",
            "ID: 38763496, Title: Effect of astaxanthin in type-2 diabetes -induced APPxhQC transgenic and NTG mice., Abstract: Aggregation and misfolding of amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau proteins, suggested to arise from post-translational modification processes, are thought to be the main cause of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Additionally, a plethora of evidence exists that links metabolic dysfunctions such as obesity, type 2 diabetes (T2D), and dyslipidemia to the pathogenesis of AD. We thus investigated the combinatory effect of T2D and human glutaminyl cyclase activity (pyroglutamylation), on the pathology of AD and whether astaxanthin (ASX) treatment ameliorates accompanying pathophysiological manifestations. Male transgenic AD mice, APPxhQC, expressing human APP751 with the Swedish and the London mutation and human glutaminyl cyclase (hQC) enzyme and their non-transgenic (NTG) littermates were used. Both APPxhQC and NTG mice were allocated to 3 groups, control, T2D-control, and T2D-ASX. Mice were fed control or high fat diet ± ASX for 13 weeks starting at an age of 11-12 months. High fat diet fed mice were further treated with streptozocin for T2D induction. Effects of genotype, T2D induction, and ASX treatment were evaluated by analysing glycemic readouts, lipid concentration, Aβ deposition, hippocampus-dependent cognitive function and nutrient sensing using immunosorbent assay, ELISA-based assays, western blotting, immunofluorescence staining, and behavioral testing via Morris water maze (MWM), respectively. APPxhQC mice presented a higher glucose sensitivity compared to NTG mice. T2D-induced brain dysfunction was more severe in NTG compared to the APPxhQC mice. T2D induction impaired memory functions while increasing hepatic LC3B, ABCA1, and p65 levels in NTG mice. T2D induction resulted in a progressive shift of Aβ from the soluble to insoluble form in APPxhQC mice. ASX treatment reversed T2D- induced memory dysfunction in NTG mice and in parallel increased hepatic pAKT while decreasing p65 and increasing cerebral p-S6rp and p65 levels. ASX treatment reduced soluble Aβ38 and Aβ40 and insoluble Aβ40 levels in T2D-induced APPxhQC mice. We demonstrate that T2D induction in APPxhQC mice poses additional risk for AD pathology as seen by increased Aβ deposition. Although ASX treatment reduced Aβ expression in T2D-induced APPxhQC mice and rescued T2D-induced memory impairment in NTG mice, ASX treatment alone may not be effective in cases of T2D comorbidity and AD.\n",
            "ID: 38763495, Title: A Novel Fatty Acid Mimetic with Pan-PPAR Partial Agonist Activity Inhibits Diet-Induced Obesity and Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease., Abstract: The prevalence of metabolic diseases is increasing globally at an alarming rate; thus, it is essential that effective, accessible, low-cost therapeutics are developed. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are transcription factors that tightly regulate glucose homeostasis and lipid metabolism and are important drug targets for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and dyslipidemia. We previously identified LDT409, a fatty acid-like compound derived from cashew nut shell liquid, as a novel pan-active PPARα/γ/δ compound. Herein, we aimed to assess the efficacy of LDT409 in vivo and investigate the molecular mechanisms governing the actions of the fatty acid mimetic LDT409 in diet-induced obese mice. C57Bl/6 mice (8-month-old) were fed a chow or high fat diet (HFD) for 4 weeks; mice thereafter received once daily intraperitoneal injections of vehicle, 10 mg/kg Rosiglitazone, 40 mg/kg WY14643, or 40 mg/kg LDT409 for 18 days while continuing the HFD. During treatments, body weight, food intake, glucose and insulin tolerance, energy expenditure, and intestinal lipid absorption were measured. On day 18 of treatment, tissues and plasma were collected for histological, molecular, and biochemical analysis. We found that treatment with LDT409 was effective at reversing HFD-induced obesity and associated metabolic abnormalities in mice. LDT409 lowered food intake and hyperlipidemia, while improving insulin tolerance. Despite being a substrate of both PPARα and PPARγ, LDT409 was crucial for promoting hepatic fatty acid oxidation and reducing hepatic steatosis in HFD-fed mice. We also highlighted a role for LDT409 in white and brown adipocytes in vitro and in vivo where it decreased fat accumulation, increased lipolysis, induced browning of WAT, and upregulated thermogenic gene Ucp1. Remarkably, LDT409 reversed HFD-induced weight gain back to chow-fed control levels. We determined that the LDT409-induced weight-loss was associated with a combination of increased energy expenditure (detectable before weight loss was apparent), decreased food intake, increased systemic fat utilization, and increased fecal lipid excretion in HFD-fed mice. Collectively, LDT409 represents a fatty acid mimetic that generates a uniquely favorable metabolic response for the treatment of multiple abnormalities including obesity, dyslipidemia, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, and diabetes. LDT409 is derived from a highly abundant natural product-based starting material and its development could be pursued as a therapeutic solution to the global metabolic health crisis.\n",
            "ID: 38763410, Title: Antidiabetic properties of Caffeoylmalic acid, a bioactive natural compound isolated from Urtica dioica., Abstract: The uncontrolled hyperglycemia that characterizes diabetes mellitus (DM) causes several complications in the organism. DM is among the major causes of deaths, and the limited efficacy of current treatments push the search for novel drug candidates, also among natural compounds. We focused our attention on caffeoylmalic acid, a phenolic derivative extracted from Urtica dioica, a plant investigated for its potential against type 2 DM. This compound was tested for its antidiabetic activity in vitro through a glucose uptake assay, in vivo in a mouse DM model and through molecular docking towards α-amylase and α-glucosidase. The effects on glucose blood level, liver enzymes, insulin and creatinine levels as well as on lipid and blood parameters, considered biochemical markers of diabetes, were also evaluated. The results showed an antidiabetic activity in vitro and in vivo, as the compound stimulates glucose absorbtion and reduces blood glucose levels. Moreover, it ameliorates lipid profile, liver and blood parameters, with moderate effect on insulin secretion. Taken together, these findings pave the way for the compounds from this class of caffeoylmalic acid as potential antidiabetic compounds.\n",
            "ID: 38763355, Title: β-hydroxybutyrate alleviates neurological deficits by restoring glymphatic and inflammation after subarachnoid hemorrhage in mice., Abstract: Both glymphatic system dysfunction and inflammatory response aggravate neurological dysfunction after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Studies have shown that β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) may mitigate painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN) by upregulating SNTA1 expression and reinstating AQP4 polarity. However, the potential of BHB to ameliorate glymphatic system function and inflammatory response in SAH mice remains uncertain. The SAH models were constructed by injection of arterial blood into cisterna Magana. Three groups of C57 mice were randomly assigned: Sham, SAH, and BHB. All mice were subjected to neurological function assessment, western blot, immunofluorescence double staining, and RNA-seq. Glymphatic system function was examined with tracer and immunofluorescence double staining, and the differential genes were examined with RNA-seq. In addition, the expression of related inflammation was detected. Compared with the SAH group, BHB reinstated AQP4 polarization by upregulating SNTA1 protein to enhance the glymphatic system. According to RNA-seq, the different genes were primarily connected to microglia activation, astrocytes, and inflammation. Western blot and immunofluorescence further confirmed that the related inflammatory protein expression levels were upregulated. BHB attenuated neuroinflammation after SAH. Ultimately, it can mitigate the neurological deficits in SAH mice. The study reveals a novel mechanism that BHB treatment mitigates neurologic impairment in SAH mice. We propose that BHB may play a neuroprotective effect by enhancing glymphatic system function and attenuating neuroinflammatory subarachnoid hemorrhage.\n",
            "ID: 38763181, Title: Recent advances in the effect of adipose tissue inflammation on insulin resistance., Abstract: Obesity is one of the major risk factors for diabetes. Excessive accumulation of fat leads to inflammation of adipose tissue, which can increase the risk of developing diabetes.. Obesity-related chronic inflammation can result in anomalies in glucose-lipid metabolism and insulin resistance, and it is a major cause of β-cell dysfunction in diabetes mellitus. Thus, a long-term tissue inflammatory response is crucial for metabolic diseases, particularly type 2 diabetes. Chronic inflammation associated with obesity increases oxidative stress, secretes inflammatory factors, modifies endocrine variables, and interferes with insulin signalling pathways, all of which contribute to insulin resistance and glucose tolerance. Insulin resistance and diabetes are ultimately caused by chronic inflammation in the stomach, pancreas, liver, muscle, and fat tissues. In this article, we systematically summarize the latest research progress on the mechanisms of adipose tissue inflammation and insulin resistance, as well as the mechanisms of cross-talk between adipose tissue inflammation and insulin resistance, with a view to providing some meaningful therapeutic strategies for the treatment of insulin resistance by controlling adipose tissue inflammation.\n",
            "ID: 38763169, Title: Prevalence of skin problems caused by insulin pump therapy and associated factors in children with type 1 diabetes mellitus: A large cross-sectional survey in China., Abstract: To document the prevalence of skin problems associated with insulin pump use and identify contributing factors among children with type 1 diabetes mellitus in China. In total, 461 children were recruited from an online community (i.e., a Wechat group) of pediatric patients with T1DM. A self-developed questionnaire was filled in by parents, collecting the information on social demographics, disease, and insulin pump therapy related characteristics and skin problems. We applied the Mann-Whitney U test, Chi square test and logistic regression analysis to identify the factors associated with skin problems. Of the 461 responders, 308 (66.8 %) children were reported to have skin problems. More specifically, 38.8 % had pigmentation changes, 22.3 % allergy/dermatitis, 20.2 % scaring, 11.5 % pain, 10.8 % infection, 10.6 % subcutaneous lipohypertrophy, and 6.1 % lipoatrophy. Logistic regression analysis showed that independent associated factors of skin problems were the caregiver's educational level as college or above, patient having skin allergies, and using the Brand 2 insulin pump (p values < 0.05). The present study documents the prevalence of skin problems and identifies associated factors, such as caregiver's education, patients skin allergies, and using a specific brand of pump. Health education should address these factors in addition to the traditionally emphasized factors.\n",
            "ID: 38763137, Title: Impact of Duration of Diabetes Mellitus on Long-term Outcome in Type 2 Diabetic Patients With Primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention After the First Myocardial Infarction., Abstract: Diabetes mellitus (DM) increases the risk of mortality in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The impact of the diabetes duration on the long-term outcome of those with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) after the first AMI is unclear. In this study, we evaluated the predictive value of diabetes duration in the occurrence of major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCEs). A total of 394 type 2 DM patients with PCI after the first AMI were enrolled and were divided into two groups by the diabetes duration. A short-DM group with diabetes duration of < 5 years and a long-DM group with a duration of ≥ 5 years. The clinical endpoint was MACCEs. Multivariate Cox regression analysis found that the diabetes duration was independently associated with increased occurrence of MACCEs [HR 1.512, 95% CI: (1.033, 2.215), p = 0.034], along with hypertension, Killip class III or IV, creatinine, multivessel disease, and continuous hypoglycemic therapy. After adjusting for the confounding variables, a nested Cox model showed that diabetes duration was still an independent risk factor of MACCEs [HR 1.963, 95% CI: (1.376, 2.801), p < 0.001]. The Kaplan-Meier survival curve illustrated a significantly high risk of MACCEs (HR 2.045, p < 0.0001) in long-duration DM patients. After propensity score matching, a longer diabetes duration was associated with an increased risk of MACCE occurrence. Long-duration diabetes was independently associated with poor clinical outcomes after PCI in patients with their first myocardial infarction, Despite the diabetes duration, continuous hypoglycemic therapy significantly improved long-term clinical outcomes.\n",
            "ID: 38762949, Title: Electroporation enhances cell death in 3D scaffold-based MDA-MB-231 cells treated with metformin., Abstract: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), the most aggressive subtype of breast cancer lacks estrogen, progesterone, and HER2 receptors and hence, is therapeutically challenging. Towards this, we studied an alternate therapy by repurposing metformin (FDA-approved type-2 diabetic drug with anticancer properties) in a 3D-scaffold culture, with electrical pulses. 3D cell culture was used to simulate the tumor microenvironment more closely and MDA-MB-231, human TNBC cells, treated with both 5 mM metformin (Met) and 8 electrical pulses at 2500 V/cm, 10 µs (EP1) and 800 V/cm, 100 µs (EP2) at 1 Hz were studied in 3D and 2D. They were characterized using cell viability, reactive oxygen species (ROS), glucose uptake, and lactate production assays at 24 h. Cell viability, as low as 20 % was obtained with EP1 + 5 mM Met. They exhibited 1.65-fold lower cell viability than 2D with EP1 + 5 mM Met. ROS levels indicated a 2-fold increase in oxidative stress for EP1 + 5 mM Met, while the glucose uptake was limited to only 9 %. No significant change in the lactate production indicated glycolytic arrest and a non-conducive environment for MDA-MB-231 growth. Our results indicate that 3D cell culture, with a more realistic tumor environment that enhances cell death using metformin and electrical pulses could be a promising approach for TNBC therapeutic intervention studies.\n",
            "ID: 38764099, Title: [Clinical effect of acupuncture combined with medication on diabetic peripheral neuropathy and its influence on serum lipid metabolism]., Abstract: To observe the clinical effect on diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) treated with acupuncture combined with medication and explore its effect mechanism. Sixty-two patients of DPN were randomly divided into a combined therapy group (31 cases) and a medication group (31 cases, 2 cases dropped out); besides, 20 healthy subjects were recruited as a normal group. On the base of routine intervention, in the medication group, thioctic acid capsules were administrated orally, 0.2 g each time, 3 times a day. In the combined therapy group, besides the medication as the medication group, acupuncture was performed on bilateral Quchi (LI 11), Waiguan (TE 5), Hegu (LI 4), Tianshu (ST 25), Zusanli (ST 36), Sanyinjiao (SP 6) and Taichong (LR 3) and the needles were retained for 30 min, acupuncture was delivered once daily, 6 times a week. The duration of treatment was 4 weeks in the two groups. The score of Toronto clinical scoring system (TCSS), the nerve conduction velocity of median nerve (MN) and common peroneal nerve (CPN) were observed before and after treatment in the two intervention groups; and the serum lipid metabolism was detected before and after treatment in the two intervention groups and the normal group. Compared with that before treatment, the scores of TCSS were reduced in the combined therapy group and the medication group (<i>P</i><0.05) after treatment, and the score decrease in the combined therapy group was larger than that of the medication group (<i>P</i><0.001). The motor nerve conduction velocity and the sensory nerve conductive velocity of MN and CPN after treatment all increased in the combined therapy group and the medication group compared with those before treatment (<i>P</i><0.05), and the improvements in the combined therapy group were larger than those of the medication group (<i>P</i><0.001). Before treatment DPN patients had 365 differential lipid metabolites, including sphingosine (SPH, d18:0), involved in the inositol phosphate metabolism, compared with the subjects of the normal group. There were 103 differential lipid metabolites in the medication group before and after treatment, including lysophosphatidyl ethanolamine (LPE, 18:1/0:0), participated in glycerophospholipid metabolism. In the combined therapy group, before and after treatment, there were 99 differential lipid metabolites, including lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC, 18:0/0:0), participated in the neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction. Acupuncture greatly affected 50 lipid metabolites such as lysophosphatidic acid (LPA, 0:0/22:6), LPA(0:0/18:2) and LPC(O-18:0), which was mainly involved in glycerophospholipid metabolism. Acupuncture combined with medication ameliorates the symptoms and the nerve conduction velocity in DPN patients, which may be related to the regulation of serum lipid metabolism.\n",
            "ID: 38764043, Title: Association of genetic variants related to combined lipid-lowering and antihypertensive therapies with risk of cardiovascular disease: 2 × 2 factorial Mendelian randomization analyses., Abstract: Lipid-lowering drugs and antihypertensive drugs are commonly combined for cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, the relationship of combined medications with CVD remains controversial. We aimed to explore the associations of genetically proxied medications of lipid-lowering and antihypertensive drugs, either alone or both, with risk of CVD, other clinical and safety outcomes. We divided 423,821 individuals in the UK Biobank into 4 groups via median genetic scores for targets of lipid-lowering drugs and antihypertensive drugs: lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) mediated by targets of statins or proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors, lower systolic blood pressure (SBP) mediated by targets of β-blockers (BBs) or calcium channel blockers (CCBs), combined genetically lower LDL-C and SBP, and reference (genetically both higher LDL-C and SBP). Associations with risk of CVD and other clinical outcomes were explored among each group in factorial Mendelian randomization. Independent and additive effects were observed between genetically proxied medications of lipid-lowering and antihypertensive drugs with CVD (including coronary artery disease, stroke, and peripheral artery diseases) and other clinical outcomes (ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, heart failure, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and dementia) (P > 0.05 for interaction in all outcomes). Take the effect of PCSK9 inhibitors and BBs on CVD for instance: compared with the reference, PCSK9 group had a 4% lower risk of CVD (odds ratio [OR], 0.96; 95%CI, 0.94-0.99), and a 3% lower risk was observed in BBs group (OR, 0.97; 95%CI, 0.94-0.99), while combined both were associated with a 6% additively lower risk (OR, 0.94; 95%CI, 0.92-0.97; P = 0.87 for interaction). Genetically proxied medications of combined lipid-lowering and antihypertensive drugs have an independent and additive effects on CVD, other clinical and safety outcomes, with implications for CVD clinical practice, subsequent trials as well as drug development of polypills.\n",
            "ID: 38764010, Title: NSUN2 affects diabetic retinopathy progression by regulating MUC1 expression through RNA m<sup>5</sup>C methylation., Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the leading cause of blinding eye disease among working adults and is primarily attributed to the excessive proliferation of microvessels, which leads to vitreous hemorrhage and retinal traction, thereby significantly impairing patient vision. NSUN2-mediated RNA m<sup>5</sup>C methylation is implicated in various diseases, and in this investigation, we focused on elucidating the impact of NSUN2 on the regulation of the expression of the downstream gene MUC1, specifically through RNA m<sup>5</sup>C methylation, on the progression of DR. Utilizing Microarray analysis, we examined patient vitreous fluid to pinpoint potential therapeutic targets for DR. Differential expression of NSUN2 was validated through qRT-PCR, Western blot, and immunofluorescence in human tissue, animal tissue, and cell model of DR. The relationship between NSUN2 and DR was explored in vitro and in vivo through gene knockdown and overexpression. Various techniques, such as MeRIP-qPCR and dot blot, were applied to reveal the downstream targets and mechanism of action of NSUN2. The levels of both NSUN2 and RNA m<sup>5</sup>C methylation were significantly elevated in the DR model. Knockdown of NSUN2 mitigated DR lesion formation both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, NSUN2 promoted MUC1 expression by binding to the RNA m<sup>5</sup>C reader ALYREF. Knockdown of ALYREF resulted in DR lesion alterations similar to those observed with NSUN2 knockdown. Moreover, MUC1 overexpression successfully reversed a series of DR alterations induced by NSUN2 silencing. NSUN2 regulates the expression of MUC1 through ALYREF-mediated RNA m<sup>5</sup>C methylation, thereby regulating the progression of DR and providing a new option for the treatment of DR in the future.\n",
            "ID: 38763955, Title: Effect of Akkermansia muciniphila on pancreatic islet β-cell function in rats with prediabetes mellitus induced by a high-fat diet., Abstract: Prediabetes is an important stage in the development of diabetes. It is necessary to find a safe, effective and sustainable way to delay and reverse the progression of prediabetes. Akkermansia muciniphila (A. muciniphila) is one of the key bacteria associated with glucose metabolism. Recent studies mainly focus on the effect of A. muciniphila on obesity and insulin resistance, but there is no research on the effect of A. muciniphila on pancreatic β-cell function and its mechanism in prediabetes. In this study, we investigated the effects of A. muciniphila on β-cell function, apoptosis and differentiation, as well as its effects on the gut microbiome, intestinal barrier, metaflammation and the expression of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in a high-fat diet (HFD)-induced prediabetic rat model. The effect of A. muciniphila was compared with dietary intervention. The results showed both A. muciniphila treatment and dietary intervention can reduce metaflammation by repairing the intestinal barrier in rats with prediabetes induced by an HFD and improve β-cell secretory function, apoptosis and differentiation through signaling pathways mediated by TLR2 and TLR4. Additionally, A. muciniphila can further elevate β-cell secretion, attenuate apoptosis and improve differentiation and the TLR signaling pathway on the basis of diet.\n",
            "ID: 38763922, Title: Assessment between antiseptic and normal saline for negative pressure wound therapy with instillation and dwell time in diabetic foot infections., Abstract: Negative pressure wound therapy with instillation and dwell time (NPWTi-d) is increasingly used for a diverse range of wounds. Meanwhile, the topical wound irrigation solution consisting of polyhexamethylene biguanide and betaine (PHMB-B) has shown efficacy in managing wound infections. However, the effectiveness of this solution as a topical instillation solution for NPWTi-d in patients with diabetic foot infections (DFIs) has not been thoroughly studied. The objective of this retrospective study was to evaluate the impact of using PHMB-B as the instillation solution during NPWTi-d on reducing bioburden and improving clinical outcomes in patients with DFIs. Between January 2017 and December 2022, a series of patients with DFIs received treatment with NPWTi-d, using either PHMB-B or normal saline as the instillation solution. Data collected retrospectively included demographic information, baseline wound characteristics, and treatment outcomes. The study included 61 patients in the PHMB-B group and 73 patients in the normal saline group, all diagnosed with DFIs. In comparison to patients treated with normal saline, patients with PHMB-B exhibited no significant differences in terms of wound bed preparation time (P = 0.5034), length of hospital stay (P = 0.6783), NPWTi-d application times (P = 0.1458), duration of systematic antimicrobial administration (P = 0.3567), or overall cost of hospitalization (P = 0.6713). The findings of the study suggest that the use of either PHMB-B or normal saline as an instillation solution in NPWTi-d for DFIs shows promise and effectiveness, yet no clinical distinction was observed between the two solutions.\n",

Their clinical and genetic features, treatment, and follow-up results were analyzed. <b>Results:</b> Among the 5 patients with MODY12 subtype, 4 were male and 1 was female, with an age of 13.4 (5.5, 14.6) years. Four of the patients were born large for gestational age, while one was born small for gestational age. Two patients were overweight or obese. Three patients exhibited typical symptoms of diabetes, while 2 were incidentally found to have elevated blood glucose level. One patient was found to have diabetic ketoacidosis at onset, who was diagnosed with congenital hyperinsulinism during the neonatal period and received diazoxide treatment, and experienced intellectual developmental delay. All 5 patients had autosomal dominant inherited diabetes within 3 generations. The fasting blood glucose at onset was 7.5 (6.5, 10.0) mmol/L, the haemoglobin, A1c (HbA1c) was 11.8% (7.5%, 13.5%), and the fasting C-peptide was 1.2 (1.1, 2.2)μg/L. The duration of follow-up was 15 (9, 32) months. One patient underwent lifestyle intervention, two received metformin orally, one received insulin therapy, and the other received subcutaneous injection of insulin combined with sulfonylurea orally. At the last follow-up, the median fasting blood glucose was 6.1 (5.1, 7.0) mmol/L, the HbA1c was 5.9% (5.7%, 7.1%), and the fasting C-peptide was 1.7 (0.9, 2.9)μg/L. One patient developed diabetic retinopathy. There were 4 missense variations in ABCC8 gene and one in-frame deletion, all of which were maternally inherited heterozygotes. <b>Conclusions:</b> MODY12 subtype is a heterogeneous disorder with the age of onset from infancy to adolescence. It can present as mild hyperglycemia or diabetic ketoacidosis, and has a high incidence of obesity. Definitive diagnosis can be achieved through genetic test, and individualized treatment is recommended based on glucose levels.\n",

Treatment with capecitabine and 5-fluorouracil induced severe hypertriglyceridemia repeatedly. Based on laboratory tests and clinical evaluations, treatment was suggested by specialists. After treatment with capecitabine, the patient's triglycerides increased from 19.7 mmol/L to 42 mmol/L. It was proposed that the patient had multifactorial chylomicronemia syndrome triggered by secondary factors. Statins, fenofibrate, ezetimib, and metformin were added to the therapy. After metastases appeared, FOLFIRI (leucovorin calcium [folinic acid], 5-fluorouracil, and irinotecan hydrochloride) chemotherapy and biological treatment (cetuximab) followed and triglycerides increased to 55.3 mmol/L.

            "ID: 38762774, Title: Evaluation of the Effectiveness of In-Hospital Exercise Rehabilitation in Middle-Aged and Elderly Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Combined with Sarcopenia Effect of Lifestyle Management on Disease Status in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus., Abstract: The aim of this study was to explore the effects of in-hospital exercise rehabilitation on glucose and lipid metabolism and healthy physical fitness in middle-aged and elderly patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) combined with sarcopenia, and to provide a reference for the effective implementation of exercise rehabilitation for middle-aged and elderly patients with T2DM combined with sarcopenia in healthcare institutions. This study retrospectively included 122 patients with T2DM combined with sarcopenia treated at the General Hospital of Ningxia Medical University from August 2017 to August 2020 and randomly divided into a control group and an experimental group. The control group was given conventional treatment and the experimental group was given exercise rehabilitation in the hospital for 12 weeks to compare the indexes related to glucose and lipid metabolism and healthy fitness in the two groups. After the intervention, the experimental group showed significant decreases in fasting blood glucose (FBG), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR), triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low-density cholesterol (LDL-C) and body fat percentage (<i>p</i> < 0.05), while high-density cholesterol (HDL-C), grip strength, lower limb extension, lower limb flexion, peak oxygen uptake were significantly higher (<i>p</i> < 0.05) and were more significant at 12 weeks compared to the 6-week intervention (<i>p</i> < 0.05). However, there were no significant changes in any of the glucose metabolism indicators in the control group before and after the intervention. A two-way repeated measures ANOVA showed that at control baseline levels, HbA1c decreased significantly in the experimental group after both 6 and 12 weeks of intervention compared to the control group (<i>p</i> < 0.05). After 6 weeks of intervention, the experimental group showed a significant decrease in body fat percentage and a significant increase in grip strength. After 12 weeks of intervention, the experimental group showed an increase in glycemic control from 33.3% to 73.3%, a significant decrease in body fat percentage and a significant increase in grip strength, lower limb extension and lower limb flexion strength and peak oxygen uptake. In-hospital exercise rehabilitation can effectively improve the glycemic and lipid profiles of patients with T2DM combined with sarcopenia and enhance their health fitness, with good clinical rehabilitation effects.\n",
            "ID: 38762728, Title: Drug release profile of a novel exenatide long-term drug delivery system (OKV-119) administered to cats., Abstract: Beneficial weight-loss properties of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) in obese people, with corresponding improvements in cardiometabolic risk factors, are well established. OKV-119 is an investigational drug delivery system that is being developed for the long-term delivery of the GLP-1RA exenatide to feline patients. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the drug release characteristics of subcutaneous OKV-119 implants configured to release exenatide for 84 days. Following a 7-day acclimation period, five purpose-bred cats were implanted with OKV-119 protypes and observed for a 112-day study period. Food intake, weekly plasma exenatide concentrations and body weight were measured. Exenatide plasma concentrations were detected at the first measured timepoint (Day 7) and maintained above baseline for over 84 Days. Over the first 28 days, reduced caloric intake and a reduction in body weight were observed in four of five cats. In these cats, a body weight reduction of at least 5% was maintained throughout the 112-day study period. This study demonstrates that a single OKV-119 implant can deliver the GLP-1RA exenatide for a months long duration. Results suggest that exposure to exenatide plasma concentrations ranging from 1.5 ng/ml to 4 ng/ml are sufficient for inducing weight loss in cats.\n",
            "ID: 38762574, Title: Network-targeted transcranial direct current stimulation of the hypothalamus appetite-control network: a feasibility study., Abstract: The hypothalamus is the key regulator for energy homeostasis and is functionally connected to striatal and cortical regions vital for the inhibitory control of appetite. Hence, the ability to non-invasively modulate the hypothalamus network could open new ways for the treatment of metabolic diseases. Here, we tested a novel method for network-targeted transcranial direct current stimulation (net-tDCS) to influence the excitability of brain regions involved in the control of appetite. Based on the resting-state functional connectivity map of the hypothalamus, a 12-channel net-tDCS protocol was generated (Neuroelectrics Starstim system), which included anodal, cathodal and sham stimulation. Ten participants with overweight or obesity were enrolled in a sham-controlled, crossover study. During stimulation or sham control, participants completed a stop-signal task to measure inhibitory control. Overall, stimulation was well tolerated. Anodal net-tDCS resulted in faster stop signal reaction time (SSRT) compared to sham (p = 0.039) and cathodal net-tDCS (p = 0.042). Baseline functional connectivity of the target network correlated with SSRT after anodal compared to sham stimulation (p = 0.016). These preliminary data indicate that modulating hypothalamus functional network connectivity via net-tDCS may result in improved inhibitory control. Further studies need to evaluate the effects on eating behavior and metabolism.\n",
            "ID: 38762564, Title: Comparison of outcomes between off-pump and on-pump coronary artery bypass graft surgery using collaborative targeted maximum likelihood estimation., Abstract: There are some discrepancies about the superiority of the off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery over the conventional cardiopulmonary bypass (on-pump). The aim of this study was estimating risk ratio of mortality in the off-pump coronary bypass compared with the on-pump using a causal model known as collaborative targeted maximum likelihood estimation (C-TMLE). The data of the Tehran Heart Cohort study from 2007 to 2020 was used. A collaborative targeted maximum likelihood estimation and targeted maximum likelihood estimation, and propensity score (PS) adjustment methods were used to estimate causal risk ratio adjusting for the minimum sufficient set of confounders, and the results were compared. Among 24,883 participants (73.6% male), 5566 patients died during an average of 8.2 years of follow-up. The risk ratio estimates (95% confidence intervals) by unadjusted log-binomial regression model, PS adjustment, TMLE, and C-TMLE methods were 0.86 (0.78-0.95), 0.88 (0.80-0.97), 0.88 (0.80-0.97), and 0.87(0.85-0.89), respectively. This study provides evidence for a protective effect of off-pump surgery on mortality risk for up to 8 years in diabetic and non-diabetic patients.\n",
            "ID: 38762560, Title: Oral administration of coenzyme Q10 ameliorates memory impairment induced by nicotine-ethanol abstinence through restoration of biochemical changes in male rat hippocampal tissues., Abstract: Substance abuse among adolescents has become a growing issue throughout the world. The significance of research on this life period is based on the occurrence of neurobiological changes in adolescent brain which makes the individual more susceptible for risk-taking and impulsive behaviors. Alcohol and nicotine are among the most available drugs of abuse in adolescents. Prolonged consumption of nicotine and alcohol leads to drug dependence and withdrawal which induce various dysfunctions such as memory loss. Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ<sub>10)</sub> is known to improve learning and memory deficits induced by various pathological conditions such as Diabetes mellitus and Alzheimer's disease. In the present study we investigated whether CoQ<sub>10</sub> treatment ameliorates memory loss following a nicotine-ethanol abstinence. Morris water maze and novel object recognition tests were done in male Wistar rats undergone nicotine-ethanol abstinence and the effect of CoQ10 was assessed on at behavioral and biochemical levels. Results indicated that nicotine-ethanol abstinence induces memory dysfunction which is associated with increased oxidative and inflammatory response, reduced cholinergic and neurotrophic function plus elevated Amyloid-B levels in hippocampi. CoQ<sub>10</sub> treatment prevented memory deficits and biochemical alterations. Interestingly, this ameliorative effect of CoQ<sub>10</sub> was found to be dose-dependent in most experiments and almost equipotential to that of bupropion and naloxone co-administration. CoQ<sub>10</sub> treatment could effectively improve memory defects induced by nicotine-ethanol consumption through attenuation of oxidative damage, inflammation, amyloid-B level and enhancement of cholinergic and neurotrophic drive. Further studies are required to assess the unknown side effects and high dose tolerability of the drug in human subjects.\n",
            "ID: 38762444, Title: Appendicular lean mass and the risk of stroke and Alzheimer's disease: a mendelian randomization study., Abstract: Appendicular lean mass (ALM) is a good predictive biomarker for sarcopenia. And previous studies have reported the association between ALM and stroke or Alzheimer's disease (AD), however, the causal relationship is still unclear, The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether genetically predicted ALM is causally associated with the risk of stroke and AD by performing Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses. A two-sample MR study was designed. Genetic variants associated with the ALM were obtained from a large genome-wide association study (GWAS) and utilized as instrumental variables (IVs). Summary-level data for stroke and AD were generated from the corresponding GWASs. We used random-effect inverse-variance weighted (IVW) as the main method for estimating causal effects, complemented by several sensitivity analyses, including the weighted median, MR-Egger, and MR-pleiotropy residual sum and outlier (MR-PRESSO) methods. Multivariable analysis was further conducted to adjust for confounding factors, including body mass index (BMI), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), low density lipoprotein-C (LDL-C), and atrial fibrillation (AF). The present MR study indicated significant inverse associations of genetically predicted ALM with any ischemic stroke ([AIS], odds ratio [OR], 0.93; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.89-0.97; P = 0.002) and AD (OR, 090; 95% CI 0.85-0.96; P = 0.001). Regarding the subtypes of AIS, genetically predicted ALM was related to the risk of large artery stroke ([LAS], OR, 0.86; 95% CI 0.77-0.95; P = 0.005) and small vessel stroke ([SVS], OR, 0.80; 95% CI 0.73-0.89; P < 0.001). Regarding multivariable MR analysis, ALM retained the stable effect on AIS when adjusting for BMI, LDL-C, and AF, while a suggestive association was observed after adjusting for T2DM. And the estimated effect of ALM on LAS was significant after adjustment for BMI and AF, while a suggestive association was found after adjusting for T2DM and LDL-C. Besides, the estimated effects of ALM were still significant on SVS and AD after adjustment for BMI, T2DM, LDL-C, and AF. The two-sample MR analysis indicated that genetically predicted ALM was negatively related to AIS and AD. And the subgroup analysis of AIS revealed a negative causal effect of genetically predicted ALM on LAS or SVS. Future studies are required to further investigate the underlying mechanisms.\n",

There is no well-established biomarker for predicting PTDM occurrence. This study evaluated the association between the abnormal 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and the PTDM incidence. A retrospective single-center study, including adult kidney transplant recipients from deceased donors, was performed between March 2021 and June 2022. age <18 years; pretransplant diabetes mellitus (DM); death with a functioning graft; loss of follow-up and/or graft failure before 6 months post-transplant. The results of pretransplant OGTT, fasting (FPG), and afternoon plasma glucose levels at hospitalization and FPG in the first, second, and third months post-transplant were evaluated. For analysis, patients were grouped according to the PTDM diagnosis: PTDM and non-PTDM. From 164 KT performed in the period, 50 (30%) were included, most male (n = 34, 68%), with a mean age of 48.3 ± 12.5 years. Nine patients (18%) developed PTDM, 44% between 3 and 6 months. General characteristics and immunosuppressive therapy were similar between the groups. The mean FPG in the pretransplant OGTT was significantly higher in the PTDM group compared with the non-PTDM group (85.7 ± 7.9 vs 79.1 ± 8.2, P = .03). The number of patients classified as impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) on the pre-transplant OGTT was significantly higher in the PTDM group. IGT in the pretransplant OGTT was associated with PTDM cases in kidney transplant recipients without a previous diagnosis of DM.\n",
            "ID: 38762367, Title: A domain specific health-related quality of life of omani patients living with chronic wounds., Abstract: Chronic wounds, defined as wounds that do not heal in a logical set of stages, impact patients' quality of life by disrupting their self-esteem, sleep, social interaction, work capacity, and psychological well-being. Chronic wounds are a prevalent problem in Oman due to the high number of patients with diabetes, sickle cell disease, road traffic accidents, and decubitus ulcer. Therefore, it is paramount to analyse the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of these patients with chronic wounds. An observational, cross-sectional, descriptive study with a quantitative approach was conducted among 275 adult patients with chronic wounds in three tertiary hospitals of Muscat from June to December 2021 using a self-reported Cardiff life wound impact questionnaire and the Bates-Jensen wound assessment tool. Data were analysed with IBM SPSS version 23 using inferential statistics and chi-square test. We found that the majority of participants were men (178; 64.7 %), aged between 41 and 60 years (107; 38.9 %), predominantly with diabetic wounds (80; 29.1 %). Respondents reported poor HRQOL across all domains: well-being (63.24 ± 18.092), physical (53.24 ± 18.387), and social (59.54 ± 19.025). Statistically significant poorer HRQOL was observed among the elderly above 60 years, illiterates, those with traumatic wounds, and those receiving medication and dressing as treatment. Our findings indicate that Omani patients with chronic wounds experience low HRQOL. It is imperative for healthcare providers to offer comprehensive care to these patients. To enhance their quality of life and alleviate suffering, evaluating both the wounds and HRQOL is essential. Such assessments will enable the optimisation of treatment and coping strategies for patients.\n",
            "ID: 38762325, Title: Burden of disease scenarios for 204 countries and territories, 2022-2050: a forecasting analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021., Abstract: Future trends in disease burden and drivers of health are of great interest to policy makers and the public at large. This information can be used for policy and long-term health investment, planning, and prioritisation. We have expanded and improved upon previous forecasts produced as part of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) and provide a reference forecast (the most likely future), and alternative scenarios assessing disease burden trajectories if selected sets of risk factors were eliminated from current levels by 2050. Using forecasts of major drivers of health such as the Socio-demographic Index (SDI; a composite measure of lag-distributed income per capita, mean years of education, and total fertility under 25 years of age) and the full set of risk factor exposures captured by GBD, we provide cause-specific forecasts of mortality, years of life lost (YLLs), years lived with disability (YLDs), and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) by age and sex from 2022 to 2050 for 204 countries and territories, 21 GBD regions, seven super-regions, and the world. All analyses were done at the cause-specific level so that only risk factors deemed causal by the GBD comparative risk assessment influenced future trajectories of mortality for each disease. Cause-specific mortality was modelled using mixed-effects models with SDI and time as the main covariates, and the combined impact of causal risk factors as an offset in the model. At the all-cause mortality level, we captured unexplained variation by modelling residuals with an autoregressive integrated moving average model with drift attenuation. These all-cause forecasts constrained the cause-specific forecasts at successively deeper levels of the GBD cause hierarchy using cascading mortality models, thus ensuring a robust estimate of cause-specific mortality. For non-fatal measures (eg, low back pain), incidence and prevalence were forecasted from mixed-effects models with SDI as the main covariate, and YLDs were computed from the resulting prevalence forecasts and average disability weights from GBD. Alternative future scenarios were constructed by replacing appropriate reference trajectories for risk factors with hypothetical trajectories of gradual elimination of risk factor exposure from current levels to 2050. The scenarios were constructed from various sets of risk factors: environmental risks (Safer Environment scenario), risks associated with communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases (CMNNs; Improved Childhood Nutrition and Vaccination scenario), risks associated with major non-communicable diseases (NCDs; Improved Behavioural and Metabolic Risks scenario), and the combined effects of these three scenarios. Using the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways climate scenarios SSP2-4.5 as reference and SSP1-1.9 as an optimistic alternative in the Safer Environment scenario, we accounted for climate change impact on health by using the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change temperature forecasts and published trajectories of ambient air pollution for the same two scenarios. Life expectancy and healthy life expectancy were computed using standard methods. The forecasting framework includes computing the age-sex-specific future population for each location and separately for each scenario. 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) for each individual future estimate were derived from the 2·5th and 97·5th percentiles of distributions generated from propagating 500 draws through the multistage computational pipeline. In the reference scenario forecast, global and super-regional life expectancy increased from 2022 to 2050, but improvement was at a slower pace than in the three decades preceding the COVID-19 pandemic (beginning in 2020). Gains in future life expectancy were forecasted to be greatest in super-regions with comparatively low life expectancies (such as sub-Saharan Africa) compared with super-regions with higher life expectancies (such as the high-income super-region), leading to a trend towards convergence in life expectancy across locations between now and 2050. At the super-region level, forecasted healthy life expectancy patterns were similar to those of life expectancies. Forecasts for the reference scenario found that health will improve in the coming decades, with all-cause age-standardised DALY rates decreasing in every GBD super-region. The total DALY burden measured in counts, however, will increase in every super-region, largely a function of population ageing and growth. We also forecasted that both DALY counts and age-standardised DALY rates will continue to shift from CMNNs to NCDs, with the most pronounced shifts occurring in sub-Saharan Africa (60·1% [95% UI 56·8-63·1] of DALYs were from CMNNs in 2022 compared with 35·8% [31·0-45·0] in 2050) and south Asia (31·7% [29·2-34·1] to 15·5% [13·7-17·5]). This shift is reflected in the leading global causes of DALYs, with the top four causes in 2050 being ischaemic heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, compared with 2022, with ischaemic heart disease, neonatal disorders, stroke, and lower respiratory infections at the top. The global proportion of DALYs due to YLDs likewise increased from 33·8% (27·4-40·3) to 41·1% (33·9-48·1) from 2022 to 2050, demonstrating an important shift in overall disease burden towards morbidity and away from premature death. The largest shift of this kind was forecasted for sub-Saharan Africa, from 20·1% (15·6-25·3) of DALYs due to YLDs in 2022 to 35·6% (26·5-43·0) in 2050. In the assessment of alternative future scenarios, the combined effects of the scenarios (Safer Environment, Improved Childhood Nutrition and Vaccination, and Improved Behavioural and Metabolic Risks scenarios) demonstrated an important decrease in the global burden of DALYs in 2050 of 15·4% (13·5-17·5) compared with the reference scenario, with decreases across super-regions ranging from 10·4% (9·7-11·3) in the high-income super-region to 23·9% (20·7-27·3) in north Africa and the Middle East. The Safer Environment scenario had its largest decrease in sub-Saharan Africa (5·2% [3·5-6·8]), the Improved Behavioural and Metabolic Risks scenario in north Africa and the Middle East (23·2% [20·2-26·5]), and the Improved Nutrition and Vaccination scenario in sub-Saharan Africa (2·0% [-0·6 to 3·6]). Globally, life expectancy and age-standardised disease burden were forecasted to improve between 2022 and 2050, with the majority of the burden continuing to shift from CMNNs to NCDs. That said, continued progress on reducing the CMNN disease burden will be dependent on maintaining investment in and policy emphasis on CMNN disease prevention and treatment. Mostly due to growth and ageing of populations, the number of deaths and DALYs due to all causes combined will generally increase. By constructing alternative future scenarios wherein certain risk exposures are eliminated by 2050, we have shown that opportunities exist to substantially improve health outcomes in the future through concerted efforts to prevent exposure to well established risk factors and to expand access to key health interventions.

            "ID: 38762324, Title: Global burden and strength of evidence for 88 risk factors in 204 countries and 811 subnational locations, 1990-2021: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021., Abstract: Understanding the health consequences associated with exposure to risk factors is necessary to inform public health policy and practice. To systematically quantify the contributions of risk factor exposures to specific health outcomes, the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2021 aims to provide comprehensive estimates of exposure levels, relative health risks, and attributable burden of disease for 88 risk factors in 204 countries and territories and 811 subnational locations, from 1990 to 2021. The GBD 2021 risk factor analysis used data from 54 561 total distinct sources to produce epidemiological estimates for 88 risk factors and their associated health outcomes for a total of 631 risk-outcome pairs. Pairs were included on the basis of data-driven determination of a risk-outcome association. Age-sex-location-year-specific estimates were generated at global, regional, and national levels. Our approach followed the comparative risk assessment framework predicated on a causal web of hierarchically organised, potentially combinative, modifiable risks. Relative risks (RRs) of a given outcome occurring as a function of risk factor exposure were estimated separately for each risk-outcome pair, and summary exposure values (SEVs), representing risk-weighted exposure prevalence, and theoretical minimum risk exposure levels (TMRELs) were estimated for each risk factor. These estimates were used to calculate the population attributable fraction (PAF; ie, the proportional change in health risk that would occur if exposure to a risk factor were reduced to the TMREL). The product of PAFs and disease burden associated with a given outcome, measured in disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), yielded measures of attributable burden (ie, the proportion of total disease burden attributable to a particular risk factor or combination of risk factors). Adjustments for mediation were applied to account for relationships involving risk factors that act indirectly on outcomes via intermediate risks. Attributable burden estimates were stratified by Socio-demographic Index (SDI) quintile and presented as counts, age-standardised rates, and rankings. To complement estimates of RR and attributable burden, newly developed burden of proof risk function (BPRF) methods were applied to yield supplementary, conservative interpretations of risk-outcome associations based on the consistency of underlying evidence, accounting for unexplained heterogeneity between input data from different studies. Estimates reported represent the mean value across 500 draws from the estimate's distribution, with 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) calculated as the 2·5th and 97·5th percentile values across the draws. Among the specific risk factors analysed for this study, particulate matter air pollution was the leading contributor to the global disease burden in 2021, contributing 8·0% (95% UI 6·7-9·4) of total DALYs, followed by high systolic blood pressure (SBP; 7·8% [6·4-9·2]), smoking (5·7% [4·7-6·8]), low birthweight and short gestation (5·6% [4·8-6·3]), and high fasting plasma glucose (FPG; 5·4% [4·8-6·0]). For younger demographics (ie, those aged 0-4 years and 5-14 years), risks such as low birthweight and short gestation and unsafe water, sanitation, and handwashing (WaSH) were among the leading risk factors, while for older age groups, metabolic risks such as high SBP, high body-mass index (BMI), high FPG, and high LDL cholesterol had a greater impact. From 2000 to 2021, there was an observable shift in global health challenges, marked by a decline in the number of all-age DALYs broadly attributable to behavioural risks (decrease of 20·7% [13·9-27·7]) and environmental and occupational risks (decrease of 22·0% [15·5-28·8]), coupled with a 49·4% (42·3-56·9) increase in DALYs attributable to metabolic risks, all reflecting ageing populations and changing lifestyles on a global scale. Age-standardised global DALY rates attributable to high BMI and high FPG rose considerably (15·7% [9·9-21·7] for high BMI and 7·9% [3·3-12·9] for high FPG) over this period, with exposure to these risks increasing annually at rates of 1·8% (1·6-1·9) for high BMI and 1·3% (1·1-1·5) for high FPG. By contrast, the global risk-attributable burden and exposure to many other risk factors declined, notably for risks such as child growth failure and unsafe water source, with age-standardised attributable DALYs decreasing by 71·5% (64·4-78·8) for child growth failure and 66·3% (60·2-72·0) for unsafe water source. We separated risk factors into three groups according to trajectory over time: those with a decreasing attributable burden, due largely to declining risk exposure (eg, diet high in trans-fat and household air pollution) but also to proportionally smaller child and youth populations (eg, child and maternal malnutrition); those for which the burden increased moderately in spite of declining risk exposure, due largely to population ageing (eg, smoking); and those for which the burden increased considerably due to both increasing risk exposure and population ageing (eg, ambient particulate matter air pollution, high BMI, high FPG, and high SBP). Substantial progress has been made in reducing the global disease burden attributable to a range of risk factors, particularly those related to maternal and child health, WaSH, and household air pollution. Maintaining efforts to minimise the impact of these risk factors, especially in low SDI locations, is necessary to sustain progress. Successes in moderating the smoking-related burden by reducing risk exposure highlight the need to advance policies that reduce exposure to other leading risk factors such as ambient particulate matter air pollution and high SBP. Troubling increases in high FPG, high BMI, and other risk factors related to obesity and metabolic syndrome indicate an urgent need to identify and implement interventions.

            "ID: 38762213, Title: Baicalin suppresses macrophage JNK-mediated adipose tissue inflammation to mitigate insulin resistance in obesity., Abstract: Radix scutellariae (the root of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi) is a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) used to treat a wide range of inflammation-related diseases, such as obesity, diabetes, diabetic kidney disease, and COVID-19-associated inflammatory states in the lung and kidney. Baicalin is the major anti-inflammatory component of Radix scutellariae and has shown the potential to inhibit inflammation in metabolic disorders. In this study, we explored the ability and underlying mechanisms of baicalin to modulate the macrophage to mitigate insulin resistance in obesity. Obese mice were administered baicalin (50 mg/kg/day) intraperitoneally for 3 weeks. RAW264.7 and BMDM cells were stimulated with LPS and treated with baicalin for 24 h, while 3T3-L1 and primary white adipocytes were treated with the supernatants from baicalin-treated RAW264.7 cells for 24 h. The results showed that baicalin significantly improved glucose and insulin tolerance as well as decreased fat and adipose tissue macrophage levels in obese mice. Besides, baicalin significantly reduced serum and adipose tissue IL-1β, TNF-α and IL-6 levels in obese mice, as well as suppressed LPS-induced IL-1β, TNF-α and IL-6 expression and release in macrophages. Furthermore, treatment with the supernatant from baicalin-treated RAW264.7 cells increased the levels of PGC-1α, SIRT1, p-IRS-1 and p-AKT in adipocytes. Moreover, baicalin treatment dramatically downregulated macrophage p-p38, p-JNK, and Ac-p65<sup>Lys310</sup> levels while increasing SIRT1 both in vivo and in vitro. Importantly, JNK inhibitor SP600125 blocked most of the effects of baicalin on SIRT1, Ac-p65<sup>Lys310</sup> and pro-inflammatory factors in macrophages. Therefore, these results demonstrated for the first time that baicalin exerts its anti-inflammatory effects in obese adipose tissue macrophages mainly through suppressing JNK/SIRT1/p65 signaling. These findings amplified the mechanisms of baicalin and its potential to attenuate insulin resistance.\n",
            "ID: 38762210, Title: Berberine directly targets AKR1B10 protein to modulate lipid and glucose metabolism disorders in NAFLD., Abstract: Berberine (BBR) is the main active component from Coptidis rhizome, a well-known Chinese herbal medicine used for metabolic diseases, especially diabetes for thousands of years. BBR has been reported to cure various metabolic disorders, such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, the direct proteomic targets and underlying molecular mechanism of BBR against NAFLD remain less understood. To investigate the direct target and corresponding molecular mechanism of BBR on NAFLD is the aim of the current study. High-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice and oleic acid (OA) stimulated HepG2 cells were utilized to verify the beneficial impacts of BBR on glycolipid metabolism profiles. The click chemistry in proteomics, DARTS, CETSA, SPR and fluorescence co-localization analysis were conducted to identify the targets of BBR for NAFLD. RNA-seq and shRNA/siRNA were used to investigate the downstream pathways of the target. BBR improved hepatic steatosis, ameliorated insulin resistance, and reduced TG levels in the NAFLD models. Importantly, Aldo-keto reductase 1B10 (AKR1B10) was first proved as the target of BBR for NAFLD. The gene expression of AKR1B10 increased significantly in the NAFLD patients' liver tissue. We further demonstrated that HFD and OA increased AKR1B10 expression in the C57BL/6 mice's liver and HepG2 cells, respectively, whereas BBR decreased the expression and activities of AKR1B10. Moreover, the knockdown of AKR1B10 by applying shRNA/siRNA profoundly impacted the beneficial effects on the pathogenesis of NAFLD by BBR. Meanwhile, the changes in various proteins (ACC1, CPT-1, GLUT2, etc.) are responsible for hepatic lipogenesis, fatty acid oxidation, glucose uptake, etc. by BBR were reversed by the knockdown of AKR1B10. Additionally, RNA-seq was used to identify the downstream pathway of AKR1B10 by examining the gene expression of liver tissues from HFD-fed mice. Our findings revealed that BBR markedly increased the protein levels of PPARα while downregulating the expression of PPARγ. However, various proteins of PPAR signaling pathways remained unaffected post the knockdown of AKR1B10. BBR alleviated NAFLD via mediating PPAR signaling pathways through targeting AKR1B10. This study proved that AKR1B10 is a novel target of BBR for NAFLD treatment and helps to find new targets for the treatment of NAFLD by using active natural compounds isolated from traditional herbal medicines as the probe.\n",
            "ID: 38762124, Title: Myeloid AMPK signaling restricts fibrosis but is not required for metformin improvements during CDAHFD-induced NASH in mice., Abstract: Metabolic programming underpins inflammatory processes of immune cells. In the context of chronic liver disease, liver macrophage activation and response to hepatocellular damage is dependent on profound metabolic changes. Here, we sought to identify the role of an important metabolic regulator, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), specifically within myeloid cells during the progression of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and whether treatment with metformin, a first line therapy for diabetes and activator of AMPK could stem disease progression. Male and female Prkaa1<sup>fl/fl</sup>/Prkaa2<sup>fl/fl</sup> (Flox) control and Flox-LysM-Cre<sup>+</sup> (MacKO) mice were fed a low-fat control or a choline-deficient, amino acid defined 45% Kcal high fat diet (CDAHFD) for 8 weeks, where metformin was introduced in the drinking water (50 or 250 mg/kg/day) for the last 4 weeks. Hepatic steatosis and fibrosis were dramatically increased in response to CDAHFD-feeding compared to low-fat control. While myeloid AMPK signaling had no effect on markers of hepatic steatosis or circulating markers, fibrosis as measured by total liver collagen was significantly elevated in livers from MacKO mice, independent of sex. Although treatment with 50 mg/kg/day metformin had no effect on any parameter, intervention with 250 mg/kg/day metformin completely ameliorated hepatic steatosis and fibrosis in both male and female mice. While the protective effect of metformin was associated with lower final body weight, decrease expression of lipogenic and Col1a1 transcripts, it was independent of myeloid AMPK signaling. These results suggest that endogenous AMPK signaling in myeloid cells, both liver-resident and infiltrating, acts to restrict fibrogenesis during CDAHFD-induced NASH progression but is not the mechanism by which metformin improves markers of NASH.\n",
            "ID: 38762101, Title: Type 2 diabetes mellitus/obesity drugs: a neurodegenerative disorders savior or a bridge too far?, Abstract: Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist-based drugs (incretin mimetics) have meaningfully impacted current treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and their actions on satiety and weight loss have led to their use as an obesity medication. With multiple pleotropic actions beyond their insulinotropic and weight loss ones, including anti-inflammatory and anti-insulin-resistant effects selectively mediated by their receptors present within numerous organs, this drug class offers potential efficacy for an increasing number of systemic and neurological disorders whose current treatment is inadequate. Among these are a host of neurodegenerative disorders that are prevalent in the elderly, such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease, which have bucked previous therapeutic approaches. An increasing preclinical, clinical, and epidemiological literature suggests that select incretin mimetics may provide an effective treatment strategy, but 'which ones' for 'which disorders' and 'when' remain key open questions.\n",
            "ID: 38762059, Title: Lactate-induced lactylation and cardiometabolic diseases: From epigenetic regulation to therapeutics., Abstract: Cardiometabolic diseases (CMDs) denote a cadre of chronic and devastating cardiovascular anomalies routed from metabolic derangements including obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. Recent studies have demonstrated the association between histone lactylation, a unique form of post-translational modification, and pathogenesis of CMDs, apparently through epigenetic mechanisms. Lactylation has been indicated to regulate key aspects of metabolism, inflammation, and cardiovascular function in the realm of CMDs in a cellular and tissue-specific manner. A better understanding of the molecular, cellular and physiological domains of lactylation in the etiology of CMDs is expected to offer new insights into etiopathogenesis, hazardous factor control and therapeutic development for these challenging ailments.\n",
            "ID: 38761896, Title: SIRT1/AMPK-mediated pathway: Ferulic acid from sugar beet pulp mitigating obesity-induced diabetes-linked complications and improving metabolic health., Abstract: Obesity-induced type 2 diabetes (T2D) increases the risk of metabolic syndrome due to the high calorie intake. The role of sugar beet pulp (SBP) in T2D and the mechanism of its action remain unclear, though it is abundant in phenolics and has antioxidant activity. In this study, we isolated and purified ferulic acid from SBP, referred to as SBP-E, and studied the underlying molecular mechanisms in the regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism developing high glucose/high fat diet-induced diabetic models in vitro and in vivo. SBP-E showed no cytotoxicity and reduced the oxidative stress by increasing glutathione (GSH) in human liver (HepG2) and rat skeletal muscle (L6) cells. It also decreased body weight gain, food intake, fasting blood glucose levels (FBGL), glucose intolerance, hepatic steatosis, and lipid accumulation. Additionally, SBP-E decreased the oxidative stress and improved the antioxidant enzyme levels in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced T2D mice. Further, SBP-E reduced plasma and liver advanced glycation end products (AGEs), malondialdehyde (MDA), and pro-inflammatory cytokines, and increased anti-inflammatory cytokines in HFD-fed mice. Importantly, SBP-E significantly elevated AMPK, glucose transporter, SIRT1 activity, and Nrf2 expression and decreased ACC expression and SREBP1 levels in diabetic models. Collectively, our study results suggest that SBP-E treatment can improve obesity-induced T2D by regulating glucose and lipid metabolism via SIRT1/AMPK signalling and the AMPK/SREBP1/ACC1 pathway.\n",
            "ID: 38761793, Title: Longitudinal artificial intelligence-based deep learning models for diagnosis and prediction of the future occurrence of polyneuropathy in diabetes and prediabetes., Abstract: The objective of this study was to develop artificial intelligence-based deep learning models and assess their potential utility and accuracy in diagnosing and predicting the future occurrence of diabetic distal sensorimotor polyneuropathy (DSPN) among individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and prediabetes. In 394 patients (T2DM=300, Prediabetes=94), we developed a DSPN diagnostic and predictive model using Random Forest (RF)-based variable selection techniques, specifically incorporating the combined capabilities of the Clinical Toronto Neuropathy Score (TCNS) and nerve conduction study (NCS) to identify relevant variables. These important variables were then integrated into a deep learning framework comprising Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. To evaluate temporal predictive efficacy, patients were assessed at enrollment and one-year follow-up. RF-based variable selection identified key factors for diagnosing DSPN. Numbness scores, sensory test results (vibration), reflexes (knee, ankle), sural nerve attributes (sensory nerve action potential [SNAP] amplitude, nerve conduction velocity [NCV], latency), and peroneal/tibial motor NCV were candidate variables at baseline and over one year. Tibial compound motor action potential amplitudes were used for initial diagnosis, and ulnar SNAP amplitude for subsequent diagnoses. CNNs and LSTMs achieved impressive AUC values of 0.98 for DSPN diagnosis prediction, and 0.93 and 0.89 respectively for predicting the future occurrence of DSPN. RF techniques combined with two deep learning algorithms exhibited outstanding performance in diagnosing and predicting the future occurrence of DSPN. These algorithms have the potential to serve as surrogate measures, aiding clinicians in accurate diagnosis and future prediction of DSPN.\n",
            "ID: 38761758, Title: Phenolic enriched fraction of Clerodendrum glandulosum Lindl. leaf extract ameliorates hyperglycemia and oxidative stress in streptozotocin-nicotinamide induced diabetic rats., Abstract: Clerodendrum glandulosum Lindl. is an important ethnomedicinal shrub of Northeast India, used by traditional healers to control various ailments like diabetes, hypertension, arthritis, etc. OBJECTIVES: The present study was conducted to explore the anti-hyperglycemic and antioxidative effects of the polyphenol-rich fraction (PRF) of C. glandulosum leaf extract and identification of its major bioactive compounds. Further, an in-silico molecular docking study was also performed to understand the molecular interactions of the identified major compounds with some target proteins associated with diabetic complications. PRF was purified from the hydromethanolic (80% MeOH) extract of leaves and subjected to assessment of in-vitro antioxidant and anti-diabetic properties. It was also subjected to evaluate the ameliorative effect during streptozotocin-nicotinamide-induced hyperglycemia in Wistar albino rats. An in-silico molecular docking study was also performed to complement the in-vitro/in-vivo studies. Chemical analysis of PRF showed the presence of phenolics like caffeic acid, verbascoside, isoverbascoside, and apigenin, of which verbascoside (598.14 ± 1.24 mg/g) was found to be the principal compound. In-vitro studies showed potent antioxidant (IC<sub>50</sub> of DPPH:32.45 ± 2.16 μg/mL; ABTS:39.08 ± 0.53 μg/mL) properties and excellent aldose reductase inhibition potential (IC<sub>50</sub> 2.18 ± 0.10 μg/mL). Treatment with PRF showed reduced blood glucose levels and increased plasma insulin levels. The results also indicate an improvement of endogenous antioxidants and suppression of inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-α) comparable to the standard. Molecular docking studies predicted promising interactions between the identified molecules and the crucial amino acid residues of the enzymes involved in the development of hyperglycemia. This study revealed the antihyperglycemic and antioxidant potential of partially purified fraction PRF of C. glandulosum leaves.\n",
            "ID: 38761711, Title: Risk factors of periprosthetic joint infection after hemiarthroplasty for displaced femoral neck fracture in the elderly: Analysis of 1619 cases in the multicenter database., Abstract: This multicenter retrospective study focuses on understanding the incidence, causative bacteria, and risk factors for Periprosthetic Joint Infection (PJI) following hemiarthroplasty in elderly patients with displaced femoral neck fractures (FNF). From 2016 to 2020, 1,619 patients were diagnosed with displaced FNFs and treated surgically across 11 centers. After exclusions, 1,438 patients (399 men and 1,039 women) were included in the study, averaging 82.1 years in age and 20.2 kg/m² in BMI, observed over 25.7 months on average. Data on demographics, medical history, surgical details, and complications were described. PJI occurred in 20 of the 1438 patients (1.4%). The causative organism was methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus in 6 patients and methicillin-resistant S. aureus in 6 patients. In patients' backgrounds, the average age was slightly higher in the non-PJI group (82.1 years) compared to the PJI group (80.4 years). There was a higher percentage of males in the PJI group (45%) than in the non-PJI group (27.5%). Drug history showed that the prevalence of anticoagulant use in the PJI group was 25%. Peripheral vascular disease and diabetes mellitus were more prevalent in the PJI group. Most patients in both groups were independent in daily activities. The blood transfusion rate was significantly higher in the PJI group (50%) than in the non-PJI group (23.8%). Notably, the incidence of hematoma was higher in the PJI group (40%). This multicenter retrospective study demonstrates a low incidence (1.4%) of PJI in elderly patients undergoing hemiarthroplasty for FNF, primarily due to Staphylococcus aureus. Increased usage of antiplatelets and anticoagulants, as well as comorbidities related to atherosclerosis, like peripheral vascular disease and diabetes mellitus, were observed in patients with PJI. Additionally, these patients experienced higher rates of blood transfusion and postoperative hematomas, highlighting the need for careful management. It should be noted, however, that this finding is a conclusion limited by study design issues, including the retrospective design, small PJI sample size, and variability in treatment approaches.\n",
            "ID: 38761503, Title: Paired plasma lipidomics and proteomics analysis in the conversion from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease., Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative condition for which there is currently no available medication that can stop its progression. Previous studies suggest that mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a phase that precedes the disease. Therefore, a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind MCI conversion to AD is needed. Here, we propose a machine learning-based approach to detect the key metabolites and proteins involved in MCI progression to AD using data from the European Medical Information Framework for Alzheimer's Disease Multimodal Biomarker Discovery Study. Proteins and metabolites were evaluated separately in multiclass models (controls, MCI and AD) and together in MCI conversion models (MCI stable vs converter). Only features selected as relevant by 3/4 algorithms proposed were kept for downstream analysis. Multiclass models of metabolites highlighted nine features further validated in an independent cohort (0.726 mean balanced accuracy). Among these features, one metabolite, oleamide, was selected by all the algorithms. Further in-vitro experiments in rodents showed that disease-associated microglia excreted oleamide in vesicles. Multiclass models of proteins stood out with nine features, validated in an independent cohort (0.720 mean balanced accuracy). However, none of the proteins was selected by all the algorithms. Besides, to distinguish between MCI stable and converters, 14 key features were selected (0.872 AUC), including tTau, alpha-synuclein (SNCA), junctophilin-3 (JPH3), properdin (CFP) and peptidase inhibitor 15 (PI15) among others. This omics integration approach highlighted a set of molecules associated with MCI conversion important in neuronal and glia inflammation pathways.\n",
            "ID: 38761345, Title: Metformin-induced changes of the gut microbiota in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: results from a prospective cohort study., Abstract: The influence of the microbiota on hypoglycemic agents is becoming more apparent. The effects of metformin, a primary anti-diabetes drug, on gut microbiota are still not fully understood. This prospective cohort study aims to investigate the longitudinal effects of metformin on the gut microbiota of 25 treatment-naïve diabetes patients, each receiving a daily dose of 1500 mg. Microbiota compositions were analyzed at baseline, and at 1, 3, and 6 months of medication using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Prior to the 3-month period of metformin treatment, significant improvements were noted in body mass index (BMI) and glycemic-related parameters, such as fasting blood glucose (FPG) and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), alongside homeostasis model assessment indices of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). At the 3-month mark of medication, a significant reduction in the α-diversity of the gut microbiota was noted, while β-diversity exhibited no marked variances throughout the treatment duration. The Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio. markedly decreased. Metformin treatment consistently increased Escherichia-Shigella and decreased Romboutsia, while Pseudomonas decreased at 3 months. Fuzzy c-means clustering identified three longitudinal trajectory clusters for microbial fluctuations: (i) genera temporarily changing, (ii) genera continuing to decrease (Bacteroides), and (iii) genera continuing to increase(Lachnospiraceae ND3007 group, [Eubacterium] xylanophilum group, Romboutsia, Faecalibacterium and Ruminococcaceae UCG-014). The correlation matrix revealed associations between specific fecal taxa and metformin-related clinical parameters HbA1c, FPG, Uric Acid (UA), high-density lipoproteincholesterol (HDL-C), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), hypersensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), triglyceride (TG) (P < 0.05). Metacyc database showed that metformin significantly altered 17 functional pathways. Amino acid metabolism pathways such as isoleucine biosynthesis predominated in the post-treatment group. Metformin's role in glucose metabolism regulation may primarily involve specific alterations in certain gut microbial species rather than an overall increase in microbial species diversity. This may suggest gut microbiota targets in future studies on metabolic abnormalities caused by metformin.\n",
            "ID: 38761298, Title: Development and Validation of a Nomogram for Predicting Nutritional Risk Based on Frailty Scores in Older Stroke Patients., Abstract: In older stroke patients with frailty, nutritional deficiencies can amplify their susceptibility, delay recovery, and deteriorate prognosis. A precise predictive model is crucial to assess their nutritional risk, enabling targeted interventions for improved clinical outcomes. To develop and externally validate a nutritional risk prediction model integrating general demographics, physical parameters, psychological indicators, and biochemical markers. The aim is to facilitate the early identification of older stroke patients requiring nutritional intervention. This was a multicenter cross-sectional study. A total of 570 stroke patients were included, 434 as the modeling set and 136 as the external validation set. The least absolute shrinkage selection operator (LASSO) regression analysis was used to select the predictor variables. Internal validation was performed using Bootstrap resampling (1000 iterations). The nomogram was constructed based on the results of logistic regression. The performance assessment relied on the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC), Hosmer--Lemeshow test, calibration curves, Brier score, and decision curve analysis (DCA). The predictive nomogram encompassed seven pivotal variables: Activities of Daily Living (ADL), NIHSS score, diabetes, Body Mass Index (BMI), grip strength, serum albumin levels, and depression. Together, these variables comprehensively evaluate the overall health and nutritional status of elderly stroke patients, facilitating accurate assessment of their nutritional risk. The model exhibited excellent accuracy in both the development and external validation sets, evidenced by AUC values of 0.934 and 0.887, respectively. Such performance highlights its efficacy in pinpointing elderly stroke patients who require nutritional intervention. Moreover, the model showed robust goodness of fit and practical applicability, providing essential clinical insights to improve recovery and prognosis for patients prone to malnutrition. Elderly individuals recovering from stroke often experience significant nutritional deficiencies. The nomogram we devised accurately assesses this risk by combining physiological, psychological, and biochemical metrics. It equips healthcare providers with the means to actively screen for and manage the nutritional care of these patients. This tool is instrumental in swiftly identifying those in urgent need of targeted nutritional support, which is essential for optimizing their recovery and managing their nutrition more effectively.\n",

They must be properly managed to avoid neurological sequelae. We aimed to describe the variations and characteristics of postoperative natremia in children who had undergone a first craniopharyngioma resection with a particular focus on the frequency of triphasic syndrome in these patients. Paediatric patients with craniopharyngiomas who underwent a first surgical resection in the neurosurgery department of the Hôpital Femme Mère Enfant (Lyon, France) between January 2010 and September 2021 were included in the present study and the medical records were analysed retrospectively. A total of 26 patients were included. Of these, 17 (65.4%) had a postoperative course characterised by the occurrence of both initial diabetes insipidus (DI) and hyponatremia a few days later. Eight patients (30.8%) presented then with isolated and persistent DI. Patients with the triphasic syndrome had a significantly higher grade of Puget classification on MRI (1 and 2), compared to the other patients. Dysnatremia is common after craniopharyngioma resections in children. This immediate postoperative complication is particularly difficult to manage and requires rapid diagnosis and prompt initiation of medical treatment to minimize fluctuations in sodium levels and avoid neurological sequelae.\n",
            "ID: 38761257, Title: Bone metabolism in diabetes: a clinician's guide to understanding the bone-glucose interplay., Abstract: Skeletal fragility is an increasingly recognised, but poorly understood, complication of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Fracture risk varies according to skeletal site and diabetes-related characteristics. Post-fracture outcomes, including mortality risk, are worse in those with diabetes, placing these people at significant risk. Each fracture therefore represents a sentinel event that warrants targeted management. However, diabetes is a very heterogeneous condition with complex interactions between multiple co-existing, and highly correlated, factors that preclude a clear assessment of the independent clinical markers and pathophysiological drivers for diabetic osteopathy. Additionally, fracture risk calculators and routinely used clinical bone measurements generally underestimate fracture risk in people with diabetes. In the absence of dedicated prospective studies including detailed bone and metabolic characteristics, optimal management centres around selecting treatments that minimise skeletal and metabolic harm. This review summarises the clinical landscape of diabetic osteopathy and outlines the interplay between metabolic and skeletal health. The underlying pathophysiology of skeletal fragility in diabetes and a rationale for considering a diabetes-based paradigm in assessing and managing diabetic bone disease will be discussed.\n",

This study explores the potential of neurotrophins, nerve growth factor (NGF), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) as urinary biomarkers in patients with OAB undergoing mirabegron therapy, a β3-adrenergic agonist. This investigation is aimed at providing insights into the potential of neurotrophins to enhance OAB diagnosis and assess treatment efficacy. Urinary NGF and BDNF levels were measured in 15 healthy controls and 30 patients with OAB. Patients were treated with mirabegron 50 mg once daily. Urinary NGF and BDNF levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method and normalized by urinary creatinine levels (NGF/Cre and BDNF/Cre). The urinary NGF/Cre and BDNF/Cre levels were compared between controls and patients with OAB and subsequently at baseline and 3 months after mirabegron treatment. Treatment efficacy was assessed with the Indevus Urgency Severity Scale (IUSS) questionnaire. Urinary NGF/Cre and BDNF/Cre levels were significantly higher in patients with OAB than in the controls (p < 0.001 and p = 0.03 respectively). Moreover, NGF/Cre and BDNF/Cre levels significantly decreased post-mirabegron treatment (p < 0.001 and p = 0.005 respectively). Patients with improvement of OAB symptoms after treatment showed lower levels of NGF/Cre at the 3-month evaluation than those with no improvement (p = 0.05). Although both NGF/Cre and BDNF/Cre levels were significantly decreased after mirabegron treatment, only NGF/Cre levels were associated with treatment response.\n",
            "ID: 38761167, Title: Novel therapeutics to treat chronic pancreatitis: targeting pancreatic stellate cells and macrophages., Abstract: Chronic pancreatitis (CP) is a persistent, recurrent, and progressive disorder that is characterized by chronic inflammation and irreversible fibrosis of the pancreas. It is associated with severe morbidity, resulting in intense abdominal pain, diabetes, exocrine and endocrine dysfunction, and an increased risk of pancreatic cancer. The etiological factors are diverse and the major risk factors include smoking, chronic alcoholism, as well as other environmental and genetic factors. The treatment and management of CP is challenging, and no definitive curative therapy is currently available. This review paper aims to provide an overview of the different cell types in the pancreas that is known to mediate disease progression and outline potential novel therapeutic approaches and drug targets that may be effective in treating and managing CP. The information presented in this review was obtained by conducting a NCBI PubMed database search, using relevant keywords. In recent years, there has been an increased interest in the development of novel therapeutics for CP. A collaborative multi-disciplinary approach coupled with a consistent funding for research can expedite progress of translating the findings from bench to bedside.\n",
            "ID: 38761087, Title: The mediating role of kynurenine pathway metabolites on the relationship between inflammation and muscle mass in oldest-old men., Abstract: Tryptophan (TRP) metabolites along the kynurenine (KYN) pathway (KP) have been found to influence muscle. Pro-inflammatory cytokines are known to stimulate the degradation of TRP down the KP. Given that both inflammation and KP metabolites have been connected with loss of muscle, we assessed the potential mediating role of KP metabolites on inflammation and muscle mass in older men. 505 men (85.0±4.2yrs) from the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men cohort study with measured D3-creatine dilution (D3Cr) muscle mass, KP metabolites, and inflammation markers (C-reactive protein (CRP), alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) and a subsample (n=305) with interleukin (IL-6, IL-1β, IL-17A) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)) were included in the analysis. KP metabolites and inflammatory markers were measured using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and immunoassays, respectively. 23-92% of the inverse relationship between inflammatory markers and D3Cr muscle mass was mediated by KP metabolites (indirect effect p<0.05). 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (3-HAA), quinolinic acid (QA), TRP, xanthurenic acid (XA), KYN/TRP, 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-HK)/3-HAA, QA/3-HAA, and nicotinamide (NAM)/QA mediated the AGP relationship. 3-HAA, QA, KYN/TRP, 3-HK/XA, HKr ratio, 3-HK/3-HAA, QA/3-HAA, and NAM/QA mediated the CRP. KYN/TRP, 3-HK/XA, and NAM/QA explained the relationship for IL-6 and 3-HK/XA and QA/3-HAA for TNF-α. No mediation effect was observed for the other cytokines (indirect effect p>0.05). KP metabolites, particularly higher ratios of KYN/TRP, 3-HK/XA, 3-HK/3-HAA, QA/3-HAA and a lower ratio of NAM/QA, mediated the relationship between inflammation and low muscle mass. Our preliminary cross-sectional data suggest that interventions to alter D3Cr muscle mass may focus on KP metabolites rather than inflammation per se.\n",
            "ID: 38761085, Title: Assessing Glycosylated Hemoglobin Thresholds for Development of Cardiovascular Disease by Racial and Ethnic Groups., Abstract: Diabetes is the strongest risk factor for cardiovascular disease, and although glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels are known to vary by race, no racial and ethnic-specific diagnostic thresholds exist for diabetes in prediction of cardiovascular disease events. The purpose of this study is to determine whether HbA1c thresholds for predicting major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) differ among racial and ethnic groups. This is a retrospective cohort study of Kaiser Permanente Northern California adult members (n=309 636) with no history of cardiovascular disease who had HbA1c values and race and ethnicity data available between 2014 and 2019. Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate the odds of MACEs by the following racial and ethnic groups: Filipino, South Asian, East Asian, Black, White, and Hispanic. A Youden index was used to calculate HbA1c thresholds for MACE prediction by each racial and ethnic group, stratified by sex. Among studied racial and ethnic groups, South Asian race was associated with the greatest odds of MACEs (1.641 [95% CI, 1.456-1.843]; <i>P</i><0.0001). HbA1c was a positive predictor for MACEs, with an odds ratio of 1.024 (95% CI, 1.022-1.025) for each 0.1% increment increase in HbA1c. HbA1c values varied between 6.0% and 7.6% in MACE prediction by race and ethnicity and sex. White individuals, South Asian individuals, East Asian women, and Black men had HbA1c thresholds for MACE prediction in the prediabetic range, between 6.0% and 6.2%. Black women, Hispanic men, and East Asian men had HbA1c thresholds of 6.2% to 6.6%, less than the typical threshold of 7.0% that is used as a treatment goal. Findings suggest that the use of race and ethnic- and sex-specific HbA1c thresholds may need to be considered in treatment goals and cardiovascular disease risk estimation.\n",
            "ID: 38761021, Title: Presence and development of diabetic retinopathy in 16 999 patients with type 1 diabetes in the Danish Registry of Diabetic Retinopathy., Abstract: To evaluate the five-year incidence of diabetic retinopathy (DR) and associated risk markers in patients with type 1 diabetes in the national Danish DR-screening programme. Based on national data, we included all 16 999 patients with type 1 diabetes in the Danish Registry of Diabetic Retinopathy, who attended the national screening programme in the period 2013-2018. According to the worse eye at first screening, DR was classified (levels 0-4) and linked with various national health registries to retrieve information on diabetes duration, systemic comorbidity, and medication. At first screening, median age and duration of diabetes were 45.0 and 16.7 years, and 57.5% were males. The prevalence and five-year incidences for DR and progression to proliferative DR (PDR) were 44.2%, 8.9% and 2.0%, respectively. In multivariable Cox models, the incidence endpoints were associated with duration of diabetes (hazard ratio [HR] 1.76, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.63-1.89, and HR 2.04, 95% CI 1.73-2.40 per 10 years), moderately low Charlson Comorbidity Index score (HR 1.27, 95% CI 1.10-1.47, and HR 2.80, 95% CI 2.23-3.51), and use of blood pressure lowering medication (HR 1.20, 95% CI 1.05-1.36, and HR 1.98, 95% CI 1.53-2.57). In a study of all patients with type 1 diabetes from the Danish DR-screening programme, we identified duration of diabetes, systemic disease and use of anti-hypertensive treatment as consistent risk markers for incident and progressive DR.\n",
            "ID: 38760999, Title: Definitive single-stage surgery for treating diabetic foot osteomyelitis: a protocolized pathway including antibiotic bone graft substitute use., Abstract: Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) are a challenging complication of diabetes mellitus, often leading to poor clinical outcomes and significant socioeconomic burdens. We evaluated the effectiveness of a definitive single-stage protocolized surgical management pathway, including the use of local antibiotic bone graft substitute, for the treatment of infected DFUs with associated osteomyelitis. A retrospective cohort study was conducted. Medical records were extracted (from January 2017 to December 2020) to establish a database consisting of patients who underwent surgical intervention for the treatment of an infected DFU with osteomyelitis. Patients were divided into conventional (control) and protocolized (intervention) surgical groups depending on the treatment received. Clinical outcomes were assessed over a 12-month follow-up period. A total of 136 consecutive patients were included (conventional = 33, protocolized = 103). The protocolized group demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in the mean number of operations performed per patient (1.2 vs. 3.5) (P < 0.001) and a shorter accumulative hospital length of stay (12.6 vs. 25.1 days) (P < 0.001) compared to the conventional group. Major amputation rates were significantly lower in the protocolized group (2% vs. 18%) (P < 0.001). Within 12 months of surgical intervention, the protocolized group exhibited an ulcer healing rate of 89%, with a low rate of recurrence (3%). The protocolized surgical pathway, including local antibiotic bone graft substitute use, demonstrated superior outcomes compared to conventional management for the treatment of infected DFUs with osteomyelitis. Further research is needed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness and generalizability of this approach.\n",
            "ID: 38760933, Title: Regional Disparities in Prehospital Delay of Acute Ischemic Stroke: The Korean Stroke Registry., Abstract: Late hospital arrival keeps patients with stroke from receiving recanalization therapy and is associated with poor outcomes. This study used a nationwide acute stroke registry to investigate the trends and regional disparities in prehospital delay and analyze the significant factors associated with late arrivals. Patients with acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack between January 2012 and December 2021 were included. The prehospital delay was identified, and its regional disparity was evaluated using the Gini coefficient for nine administrative regions. Multivariate models were used to identify factors significantly associated with prehospital delays of >4.5 h. A total of 144,014 patients from 61 hospitals were included. The median prehospital delay was 460 min (interquartile range, 116-1912), and only 36.8% of patients arrived at hospitals within 4.5 h. Long prehospital delays and high regional inequality (Gini coefficient > 0.3) persisted throughout the observation period. After adjusting for confounders, age > 65 years old (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.23; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.19-1.27), female sex (aOR = 1.09; 95% CI, 1.05-1.13), hypertension (aOR = 1.12; 95% CI, 1.08-1.16), diabetes mellitus (aOR = 1.38; 95% CI, 1.33-1.43), smoking (aOR = 1.15, 95% CI, 1.11-1.20), premorbid disability (aOR = 1.44; 95% CI, 1.37-1.52), and mild stroke severity (aOR = 1.55; 95% CI, 1.50-1.61) were found to independently predict prehospital delays of >4.5 h. Prehospital delays were lengthy and had not improved in Korea, and there was a high regional disparity. To overcome these inequalities, a deeper understanding of regional characteristics and further research is warranted to address the vulnerabilities identified.\n",
            "ID: 38760852, Title: Response to semaglutide of non-drinker subjects with type 2 diabetes., Abstract: Metabolic dysfunction-associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD) displays a worse prognosis in subjects with type 2 diabetes (T2D); effective treatments are, so far, scanty. Semaglutide showed efficacy in improving steatohepatitis. We longitudinally observed a MASLD cohort of T2D subjects starting semaglutide, to detect an improvement of non-invasive surrogates of steatosis and fibro-inflammatory liver involvement, evaluating the role of mild alcohol consumption. In 62 overweight/obese T2D subjects with MASLD (36 non-drinker and 26 mild alcohol consumers), anthropometric, bio-humoral and transient elastography (TE) data were collected before (T0) and after an average time of 6.4 month (T1) from injective semaglutide prescription. Circulating levels of hormones (GIP, GLP-1, glucagon, insulin) and inflammatory markers (TNFα, MCP-1, IL-18, IL-10) were measured. Steatotic and necro-inflammatory liver involvement was evaluated with FibroScan controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) and liver stiffness (LS), respectively. Significant (p < 0.006) T0-T1 reductions of BMI, waist circumference, fasting glucose, and HbA1c were observed. AST (-10 ± 3 IU/L), ALT (-18 ± 5 IU/L), GGT (-33 ± 15 IU/L), CAP (-25 ± 8 dB/m) and LS (-0.8 ± 0.4 kPa) were reduced, too. GLP-1 increased (+ 95.9 pM, p < 0.0001) and IL-18 was reduced (-46.6 pg/ml, p = 0.0002). After adjustment for confounders, CAP improving was only related to GLP-1 increase (ß=-0.437, p = 0.0122). Mild alcohol intake did not influence these relations. Use of semaglutide in subjects with T2D and MASLD is associated with a significant decline of liver steatosis and necroinflammation proxies; mild alcohol assumption did not exert any influence. An independent effect of GLP-1 raise was observed on reduction of steatosis, irrespective of alcohol consumption.\n",
            "ID: 38760705, Title: Characterization of the gut microbiota in polycystic ovary syndrome with dyslipidemia., Abstract: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is an endocrinopathy in childbearing-age females which can cause many complications, such as diabetes, obesity, and dyslipidemia. The metabolic disorders in patients with PCOS were linked to gut microbial dysbiosis. However, the correlation between the gut microbial community and dyslipidemia in PCOS remains unillustrated. Our study elucidated the different gut microbiota in patients with PCOS and dyslipidemia (PCOS.D) compared to those with only PCOS and healthy women. In total, 18 patients with PCOS, 16 healthy females, and 18 patients with PCOS.D were enrolled. The 16 S rRNA sequencing in V3-V4 region was utilized for identifying the gut microbiota, which analyzes species annotation, community diversity, and community functions. Our results showed that the β diversity of gut microbiota did not differ significantly among the three groups. Regarding gut microbiota dysbiosis, patients with PCOS showed a decreased abundance of Proteobacteria, and patients with PCOS.D showed an increased abundance of Bacteroidota compared to other groups. With respect to the gut microbial imbalance at genus level, the PCOS.D group showed a higher abundance of Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1 compared to other two groups. Furthermore, the abundances of Faecalibacterium and Holdemanella were lower in the PCOS.D than those in the PCOS group. Several genera, including Faecalibacterium and Holdemanella, were negatively correlated with the lipid profiles. Pseudomonas was negatively correlated with luteinizing hormone levels. Using PICRUSt analysis, the gut microbiota community functions suggested that certain metabolic pathways (e.g., amino acids, glycolysis, and lipid) were altered in PCOS.D patients as compared to those in PCOS patients. The gut microbiota characterizations in patients with PCOS.D differ from those in patients with PCOS and controls, and those might also be related to clinical parameters. This may have the potential to become an alternative therapy to regulate the clinical lipid levels of patients with PCOS in the future.\n",
            "ID: 38760678, Title: AMPK activation eliminates senescent cells in diabetic wound by inducing NCOA4 mediated ferritinophagy., Abstract: Diabetic wounds are one of the long-term complications of diabetes, with a disordered microenvironment, diabetic wounds can easily develop into chronic non-healing wounds, which can impose a significant burden on healthcare. In diabetic condition, senescent cells accumulate in the wound area and suppress the wound healing process. AMPK, as a molecule related to metabolism, has a close relationship with aging and diabetes. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of AMPK activation on wound healing and explore the underlying mechanisms. AMPK activator A769662 was topically applied in wound models of diabetic mice. Alterations in the wound site were observed and analyzed by immunohistochemistry. The markers related to autophagy and ferritinophagy were analyzed by western blotting and immunofluorescence staining. The role of AMPK activation and ferritinophagy were also analyzed by western blotting. Our results show that AMPK activation improved diabetic wound healing and reduced the accumulation of senescent cells. Intriguingly, we found that AMPK activation-induced ferroptosis is autophagy-dependent. We detected that the level of ferritin had deceased and NCOA4 was markedly increased after AMPK activation treatment. We further investigated that NCOA4-mediated ferritinophagy was involved in ferroptosis triggered by AMPK activation. Most importantly, AMPK activation can reverse the ferroptosis-insensitive of senescent fibroblast cells in diabetic mice wound area and promote wound healing. These results suggest that activating AMPK can promote diabetic wound healing by reversing the ferroptosis-insensitive of senescent fibroblast cells. AMPK may serve as a regulatory factor in senescent cells in the diabetic wound area, therefore AMPK activation can become a promising therapeutic method for diabetic non-healing wounds.\n",
            "ID: 38760661, Title: Association between lipid accumulation product and psoriasis among adults: a nationally representative cross-sectional study., Abstract: Lipid accumulation product (LAP) is an accessible and relatively comprehensive assessment of obesity that represents both anatomical and physiological lipid accumulation. Obesity and psoriasis are potentially related, according to previous research. Investigating the relationship between adult psoriasis and the LAP index was the goal of this study. This is a cross-sectional study based on data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2003-2006 and 2009-2014. The association between LAP and psoriasis was examined using multivariate logistic regression and smoothed curve fitting. To verify whether this relationship was stable across populations, subgroup analyses and interaction tests were performed. The LAP index showed a positive correlation with psoriasis in 9,781 adult participants who were 20 years of age or older. A 27% elevated probability of psoriasis was linked to every unit increase in ln LAP in the fully adjusted model (Model 3: OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.06-1.52). In comparison with participants in the lowest ln LAP quartile, those in the highest quartile had an 83% greater likelihood of psoriasis (Model 3: OR 1.83, 95% CI 1.08-3.11). This positive correlation was more pronounced for young males, participants who had never smoked, non-drinkers, participants who exercised little, as well as non-hypertensive and non-diabetic participants. This study found that the LAP index and adult psoriasis were positively correlated, especially in young males without comorbidities. Therefore, it is proposed that LAP may serve as a biomarker for early diagnosis of psoriasis and tracking the effectiveness of treatment.\n",
            "ID: 38760632, Title: Medical treatment of functional pituitary adenomas, trials and tribulations., Abstract: Functioning pituitary adenomas (FPAs) include most frequently prolactinomas, somatotroph or corticotroph adenomas, while thyrotroph and gonadotroph adenomas are very rare. Despite their benign histological nature (aggressive tumors are rare and malignant ones exceptional), FPAs could cause significant morbidity and increased mortality due to complications associated with hormonal excess syndromes and/or mass effect leading to compression of adjacent structures. This mini review will focus on the increasing role of medical therapy in the multimodal treatment, which also includes transsphenoidal surgery (TSS) and radiotherapy. Most patients with prolactinomas are treated only with medications, but surgery could be considered for some patients in a specialized pituitary center, if higher chances of cure. Dopamine agonists, especially cabergoline, are efficient in reducing tumor size and normalizing prolactin. TSS is the first-line treatment for all other FPAs, but most patients require complex adjuvant treatment, including a combination of therapeutic approaches. Medical therapy is the cornerstone of treatment in all patients after unsuccessful surgery or when surgery cannot be offered and includes somatostatin receptor ligands and dopamine agonists (almost all FPAs), growth hormone receptor antagonists (acromegaly), adrenal steroidogenesis inhibitors and glucocorticoid receptor blockers (Cushing's disease). Novel medical treatments, especially for acromegaly and Cushing's disease are under research. An enlarged panel of effective drugs available with increased knowledge of predictive factors for response and/or adverse effects will enhance the possibility to offer a more individualized treatment. This would not only improve disease control and prognosis, but also quality of life.\n",
            "ID: 38760595, Title: Therapy-Related Satisfaction and Quality of Life for Japanese People with Diabetes Using Rapid-Acting Insulin Analogs: A Web-Based Survey., Abstract: People with diabetes require insulin to regulate blood glucose (BG); rapid-acting insulin analogs (RAIA) represent one approach for BG management. New fast-acting RAIA administered at the start of a meal suppress postprandial BG better than conventional RAIA. New RAIA are expected to confer higher treatment satisfaction and improved quality of life (QOL) than conventional RAIA. This cross-sectional, web-based survey in Japan (November 2022) included people with diabetes (type 1/2), aged ≥ 18 years, registered in the Rakuten Insight Diabetes Panel, using new and/or conventional RAIA. RAIA-specific satisfaction was evaluated by questions on RAIA use (scores: 1 [not at all satisfied]; 7 [very satisfied]) and QOL by the Diabetes Therapy-Related (DTR)-QOL questionnaire (scores: 0-100, 100 = best) for the whole population (primary endpoint) and for new versus conventional RAIA users (secondary endpoint). Multiple regression models were used to compare new versus conventional RAIA users. The analysis population comprised 217 people with diabetes (new RAIA, n = 109; conventional RAIA, n = 108). Mean (standard deviation) RAIA-specific satisfaction scores ranged from 5.1 (1.2) to 5.4 (1.2); DTR-QOL total score was 51.6 (20.4). RAIA satisfaction scores were numerically higher for new versus conventional RAIA users; no difference in DTR-QOL total score was observed. DTR-QOL satisfaction with treatment domain score was significantly higher in new versus conventional RAIA users (least squares mean difference [standard error]: 7.3 [3.1]; 95% confidence interval: 1.2, 13.4; P = 0.0197). RAIA-specific satisfaction was higher among patients who discussed BG sufficiently with their doctor versus those who did not. New RAIA users have greater treatment satisfaction than conventional RAIA users. QOL was similar among new and conventional RAIA users, except for satisfaction with treatment, which was significantly higher among new RAIA users. Detailed explanations from the doctor to the person with diabetes about the relationship between new RAIA and BG status are essential. A graphical plain language summary is available with this article.\n",

One hundred twenty-three (n = 123) women with FMS completed demographic (age, height, weight), clinical (years with pain, intensity of pain at rest and during daily living activities), functional (quality of life, physical function), sensory-related (sensitization-associated and neuropathic-associated symptoms), psychophysical (pressure pain thresholds), psychological (sleep quality, depressive and anxiety level) and cognitive (pain catastrophizing, kinesiophobia) variables. Those three genotypes of the OPRM1 rs1799971, HTR1B rs6296 and COMT rs4680 single nucleotide polymorphisms were obtained by polymerase chain reactions from no-stimulated whole saliva collection. No significant differences in demographic, clinical, functional, sensory-related, psychophysical, psychological and cognitive variables according to OPRM1 rs1799971, HTR1B rs6296 or COMT rs4680 genotype were identified in our sample of women with FMS. A multilevel analysis did not either reveal any significant gene-to-gene interaction between OPRM1 rs1799971 x HTR1B rs6296, OPRM1 rs1799971 x COMT rs4680 and HTR1B rs6296 x COMT rs4680 for any of the investigated outcomes. This study revealed that three single nucleotide polymorphisms, OPRM1 rs1799971, HTR1B rs6296 or COMT rs4680, mostly associated with chronic pain were not involved in phenotyping features of FMS. Potential gene-to-gene interaction and their association with clinical phenotype in women with FMS should be further investigated in future studies including large sample sizes.\n",
            "ID: 38760452, Title: Comparison of HIIT and MICT and further detraining on metabolic syndrome and asprosin signaling pathway in metabolic syndrome model of rats., Abstract: Physical activity promotes various metabolic benefits by balancing pro and anti-inflammatory adipokines. Recent studies suggest that asprosin might be involved in progression of metabolic syndrome (MetS), however, the underlying mechanisms have not been understood yet. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of high-intensity interval training (HIIT), moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT), and further detraining on MetS indices, insulin resistance, serum and the liver levels of asprosin, and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway in menopause-induced MetS model of rats. A total of 64 Wistar rats were used in this study and divided into eight groups: Sham1, OVX1 (ovariectomized), Sham2, OVX2, OVX + HIIT, OVX + MICT, OVX + HIIT + Det (detraining), and OVX + MICT + Det. Animals performed the protocols, and then serum concentrations of asprosin, TNF-α, insulin, fasting blood glucose, and lipid profiles (TC, LDL, TG, and HDL) were assessed. Additionally, the liver expression of asprosin, AMPK, and P-AMPK was measured by western blotting. Both HIIT and MICT caused a significant decrease in weight, waist circumference, BMI (P = 0.001), and serum levels of glucose, insulin, asprosin (P = 0.001), triglyceride, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and TNF-α (P = 0.001), but an increase in the liver AMPK, P-AMPK, and P-AMPK/AMPK (P = 0.001), compared with OVX2 noexercised group. MICT was superior to HIIT in reducing serum asprosin, TNF-a, TG, LDL (P = 0.001), insulin, fasting blood glucose, HOMA-IR, and QUEKI index (P = 0.001), but an increase in the liver AMPK, and p-AMPK (P = 0.001). Although after two months of de-training almost all indices returned to the pre exercise values (P < 0.05). The findings suggest that MICT effectively alleviates MetS induced by menopause, at least partly through the activation of liver signaling of P-AMPK and the reduction of asprosin and TNF-α. These results have practical implications for the development of exercise interventions targeting MetS in menopausal individuals, emphasizing the potential benefits of MICT in mitigating MetS-related complications.\n",

Conventional diagnostic tools and standard treatment regimens have only managed to achieve limited success in the management of patients suspected of glioblastoma. Extracellular vesicles are an emerging liquid biopsy tool that has shown great promise in resolving the limitations presented by the heterogeneous nature of glioblastoma. Here we discuss the contrasting yet interdependent dual role of extracellular vesicles as communication agents that contribute to the progression of glioblastoma by creating a heterogeneous microenvironment and as a liquid biopsy tool providing an opportunity to accurately identify the disease severity and progression.\n",

Clinical and self-reported periodontitis, along with sociodemographic data, were collected from 197 adults. Akaike information criterion models were developed to identify periodontitis, and nomograms developed based on its regression coefficients. The discriminatory capability was evaluated by receiver-operating characteristic curves. Decision curve analysis was performed. Smoking [OR 3.69 (95%CI 1.89, 7.21)], poor/fair self-rated oral health [OR 6.62 (95%CI 3.23, 13.56)], previous periodontal treatment [OR 9.47 (95%CI 4.02, 22.25)], and tooth loss [OR 4.96 (95%CI 2.47, 9.97)], determined higher probability of having \"Moderate/Severe Periodontitis\". Age [OR 1.08 (95%CI 1.05, 1.12)], low educational level [OR 1.65 (95%CI 1.34, 2.23)], poor/fair self-rated oral health [OR 3.57 (95%CI 1.82, 6.99)], and previous periodontal treatment [OR 6.66 (95%CI 2.83, 15.68)] determined higher probability for \"Any Periodontitis\". Both nomograms showed excellent discriminatory capability (AUC of 0.83 (95%CI 0.75, 0.91) and 0.81 (95% CI 0.74, 0.88), good calibration, and slight overestimation of high risk and underestimation of low risk. Hence, our nomograms could help identify periodontitis among adults in Denmark.\n",
            "ID: 38760126, Title: Are novel plant-based meat alternatives the healthier choice?, Abstract: The global market for plant-based meat alternatives (PBMAs) is expanding quickly. In this narrative review, analysis of the most recent scientific literature was achieved to understand the nutritional profile, health implications, and the challenges faced by PBMAs. On the positive side, most PBMAs are good sources of dietary fiber, contain phytochemicals, have comparable levels of iron, and are lower in calories, saturated fat, and cholesterol than meat. However, PBMAs frequently contain anti-nutrients, have less protein, iron, and vitamin B<sub>12</sub>, are lower in protein quality, and also have higher amounts of sodium. Substituting PBMAs for meats may cause iron, vitamin B<sub>12</sub>, and less likely protein deficiency for these vulnerable population such as women, older adults, and individuals with disorders. PBMAs fall into the category of ultra-processed foods, indicating a need to develop minimally processed, clean-label products. Replacing red meat with healthy plant-based foods is associated with lower risks of cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, and total mortality. There is a lack of robust, long-term evidence on the role of PBMAs consumption in health. As the nutrient contents of PBMAs can vary, consumers must read nutrition facts labels and ingredient lists to select a product that best fits their nutritional and health objectives.\n",
            "ID: 38760125, Title: The impact of addition of pearl millet starch-germ complex in white bread on nutritional, textural, structural, and glycaemic response: Single blinded randomized controlled trial in healthy and pre-diabetic participants., Abstract: The rise of pre-diabetes at the global level has created a significant interest in developing low glycaemic index food products. The pearl millet is a cheaper source of starch and its germ contains significant amount of protein and fat. The complexing of pearl millet starch and germ by dry heat treatment (PMSGH) resulted an increase in the resistant starch content upto 45.09 % due to formation of amylose-glutelin-linoleic acid complex. The resulting pearl millet starch germ complex was incorporated into wheat bread at 20, 25, and 30 %. The PMSGH incorporated into bread at 30 % reduced the glycaemic index to 52.31. The PMSGH incorporated bread had significantly (p < 0.05)increased in the hardness with a reduction in springiness and cohesiveness. The structural attributes of the 30 % PMSGH incorporated bread revealed a significant (p < 0.05)increase in 1040/1020 cm<sup>-1</sup> ratio and relative crystallinity. The consumption of functional bread incorporated with pearl millet starch germ complex reduced blood glucose levels and in vivo glycaemic index in healthy and pre-diabetic participants when compared to white bread. Hence, the study showed that the incorporation of pearl millet starch-germ complex into food products could be a potential new and healthier approach for improving dietary options in pre-diabetes care.\n",
            "ID: 38760053, Title: Feasibility and acceptability of a tailored health coaching intervention to improve type 2 diabetes self-management in Saudi Arabia: a mixed-methods randomised feasibility trial., Abstract: Around one-third of the population of Saudi Arabia have been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, a condition often requiring lifestyle changes. Personalised health coaching, a strategy developed to assist individuals in overcoming challenges to adopt healthy behaviours, has not yet been widely applied in the country. We aim to explore the feasibility and acceptability of tailored health coaching in Saudi Arabia, in order to help those with type 2 diabetes to more effectively manage their condition. Using a mixed-methods approach, this research involved a randomised controlled trial with 30 Saudi adults who have type 2 diabetes. They were randomly allocated into either the intervention or control arm for 12 weeks. The Capability, Opportunity, Motivation and Behaviour framework was used to guide the intervention implementation along with the Behaviour Change Techniques Taxonomy V.1. The primary goal was to assess the suitability and duration of the intervention, recruitment, retention and completion rates. The secondary outcome focused on the preliminary efficacy of the health coaching measured by the glycaemic index, blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, weight, patient self-efficacy and diabetes self-management. The results showed high rates of eligibility, recruitment and retention (a screening rate of 90%, a recruiting rate of 79% and a retention rate of 97%). Notable improvements were observed in the health coaching group across five outcomes: haemoglobin A1c, BMI, waist circumference, patient self-efficacy and diabetes self-care. Qualitative findings highlighted the participants' perceived benefits from the intervention, including enhanced motivation, better understanding of diabetes management and a supportive coaching relationship. Participants expressed high satisfaction with the intervention and advocated for its expansion. The findings demonstrated positive outcomes, supporting the need for a larger randomised controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of health coaching in improving diabetes self-management among individuals with type 2 diabetes in Saudi Arabia.\n",
            "ID: 38760035, Title: Preferred sources of information on diabetes prevention programmes: a population-based cross-sectional study in Poland., Abstract: This study aimed to analyse preferred sources of information on diabetes prevention programmes and to identify sociodemographic determinants influencing these preferences among adults in Poland. A cross-sectional survey was carried out between 15 and 18 September 2023 using a computer-assisted web interview. A self-prepared questionnaire included 10 questions on sources of information on type 2 diabetes prevention. Data were obtained from 1046 adults (18-82 years); 53.4% were females. Most respondents preferred email communication (46.4%), followed by a doctor or nurse (33.5%), and a letter or leaflet directly delivered to the mailbox (25.8%) for type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) prevention information. Younger respondents were more likely to indicate mass media (OR=1.81, 95% CI=1.12 to 2.95, p=0.01) and digital media (OR=1.65, 95% CI=1.02 to 2.67, p=0.04) as a source of information on DM2 prevention. Those who had higher education (OR=1.51, 95% CI=1.16 to 1.96, p=0.002), as well as those with chronic diseases (OR=1.50, 95% CI=1.14 to 1.97, p=0.004), were more likely to indicate digital media. Out of 10 different variables analysed in this study, passive occupational status (OR=1.43, 95% CI=1.04 to 1.96, p=0.03) as well as having chronic diseases (OR=1.51, 95% CI=1.16 to 1.96, p=0.002) were associated with higher odds of indicating healthcare workers as a preferred source of information. Marital status, having children, place of residence, household characteristics and financial status do not significantly decide communication preferences. Communication on DM2 prevention should be adjusted to public preferences and expectations. Tailoring interventions to different demographic groups can enhance outreach and engagement. Email emerged as a popular choice, suggesting the potential of digital communication in preventive health programmes.\n",
            "ID: 38760033, Title: Effect of metformin use on graft and patient survival in kidney transplant recipients with type 2 diabetes: a systematic review protocol., Abstract: Metformin is a first-line antihyperglycaemic agent for type 2 diabetes (T2DM). In addition to glycaemic control, it offers benefits related to cardiovascular health, weight neutrality and metabolic syndrome. However, its benefits in kidney transplant recipients remain unclear as metformin use is controversial in this population due to a lack of evidence and there are recommendations against its use in patients with poor kidney function. Hence, we seek to describe a protocol for a systematic review, which will assess the impact of metformin use on graft survival and mortality in kidney transplant recipients. This protocol was guided by the standards of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses for Protocols 2015. We will search empirical databases such as MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, CINAHL and Web of Science Core Collection for relevant studies conducted in kidney transplant recipients using metformin, which report outcomes related to graft and patient survival. All studies meeting these criteria in adults and published in English from inception to 2023 will be included in our review. We will employ the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool 2 for randomised controlled trials and the Risk of Bias in Non-randomised Studies of Intervention for non-randomised studies. We will present our data and study characteristics in a table format and determine if a meta-analysis can be performed by clinical and methodological heterogeneity, using the I<sup>2</sup> statistics. If a meta-analysis cannot be performed, we will provide a narrative synthesis of included studies using the Synthesis Without Meta-Analysis Reporting Guideline. Ethical approval will not be required for this review as the data used will be extracted from already published studies with publicly accessible data. As this study will assess the impact of metformin use on graft and patient survival in kidney transplant recipients, evidence gathered through it will be disseminated using traditional approaches that include open-access peer-reviewed publication, scientific presentations and a report. We will also disseminate our findings to appropriate academic bodies in charge of publishing guidelines related to T2DM and transplantation, as well as patient and research centred groups.

            "ID: 38759874, Title: Long-Term therapy with CFTR modulators consistently improves glucose metabolism in adolescents and adults with Cystic Fibrosis., Abstract: Impaired glycemic control and the subsequent development of Cystic fibrosis Related Diabetes (CFRD) are prevalent complications, affecting up to 50% of adults with cystic fibrosis (CF). CFTR modulator (CFTRm) therapies improve pulmonary functions, reduce exacerbation rates, increase survival in people with CF (pwCF) and appear to have a positive effect on extrapulmonary manifestations, such as nutritional state, improvements in upper respiratory symptoms, and quality of life. Initial findings indicate that CFTRm may have a positive impact on short-term glycemic control; however, long-term effects remain uncertain at present. In this retrospective study, data were collected and analyzed on 15 pwCF, ages 13-37 years, started on CFTRm therapy. Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) results were compared pre- and post-CFTRm therapy. The 120-minute OGTT value decreased from 159.7 to 130.4 post-CFTRm (p = 0.047). The average time elapsed between the two OGTT tests was 49.87 months (ranging 9-157 months, median 38 months). Glycemic status improved in six pwCF (two CFRD to normal (NGT)/indeterminate (INDET) glucose tolerance; two impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) to INDET; two INDET to NGT) and worsened in one (IGT to CFRD). Six pwCF and NGT remained stable with no changes in glycemic statues throughout the follow-up period. CFTRm therapy may decelerate the glycemic control deterioration in pwCF over an extended period. These findings indicate the need for periodic OGTTs following the initiation of CFTRm therapy to appropriately adjust insulin requirements and prevent hypoglycemia. Further larger cohorts are required to authenticate and substantiate these findings.\n",

(M. dioica Roxb.) a nutritious and therapeutic property rich crop of Cucurbitaceae plant family. In various folklore medicine including Ayurveda fruits are used to treat several metabolic related disorders i.e., hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, obesity etc. Furthermore, traditionally it is used to treat fever, inflammation, ulcer, skin diseases, haemorrhoids, hypertension and also employed as cardioprotective, hepatoprotective, analgesic, diuretic. This study focuses to explore the therapeutic potential of Momordica dioica Roxb. ex Willd. through in-vitro and in-silico approach for managing hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia and related metabolic disorders along with its phytochemical profiling for quality evaluation and validation of traditional claim. The present study was carried out on hydroalcohol extract of dried leaf and fruit of Momordica dioica. In-vitro antioxidant potential using DPPH and Nitric oxide scavenging assay along with in-vitro enzyme inhibitory potential against α-amylase, α-glucosidase, and pancreatic lipase enzymes was studied. The bioactive metabolites were identified from the most potent bioactive extract by analysis with LC-QTOF-MS and also studied their role to lessen the metabolic related disorder through in-silico approaches. The results confirmed that the fruit extract is more active to possess antioxidant and prominent enzyme inhibition potential compared to the leaf. Sixteen identified metabolites in M. dioica Roxb. fruits may be responsible for the therapeutic potential related to metabolic related disorder. The in-silico study of the identified phytomolecules against α-amylase, α-glucosidase and pancreatic lipase showed significant docking scores ranging from -9.8 to -5.5, -8.3 to -4.8 and -8.3 to -6 respectively. The current study illustrated that M. dioica Roxb., a traditionally important plant is potential against metabolic related disorders. Phytocomponents present in the fruit extract may be responsible for antioxidant as well as the enzymes' inhibitory potential. Thus, fruits of M. dioica Roxb. will be useful as alternative therapeutics for treatment of hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia and related metabolic disorders.\n",

            "ID: 38759707, Title: Healing the Diabetic Wound: Unlocking the Secrets of Genes and Pathways., Abstract: Diabetic wounds (DWs) are open sores that can occur anywhere on a diabetic patient's body. They are often complicated by infections, hypoxia, oxidative stress, hyperglycemia, and reduced growth factors and nucleic acids. The healing process involves four phases: homeostasis, inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling, regulated by various cellular and molecular events. Numerous genes and signaling pathways such as VEGF, TGF-β, NF-κB, PPAR-γ, MMPs, IGF, FGF, PDGF, EGF, NOX, TLR, JAK-STAT, PI3K-Akt, MAPK, ERK, JNK, p38, Wnt/β-catenin, Hedgehog, Notch, Hippo, FAK, Integrin, and Src pathways are involved in these events. These pathways and genes are often dysregulated in DWs leading to impaired healing. The present review sheds light on the pathogenesis, healing process, signaling pathways, and genes involved in DW. Further, various therapeutic strategies that target these pathways and genes via nanotechnology are also discussed. Additionally, clinical trials on DW related to gene therapy are also covered in the present review.\n",
            "ID: 38759658, Title: Cardiovascular outcomes in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia on lipoprotein apheresis initiated during childhood: long-term follow-up of an international cohort from two registries., Abstract: Homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia (HoFH) is a rare genetic disease characterised by extremely high plasma LDL cholesterol from birth, causing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease at a young age. Lipoprotein apheresis in combination with lipid-lowering drugs effectively reduce LDL cholesterol, but long-term health outcomes of such treatment are unknown. We aimed to investigate the long-term cardiovascular outcomes associated with lipoprotein apheresis initiated in childhood or adolescence. In this cohort study, data were drawn from the HoFH International Clinical Collaboration (HICC) and the international registry for Children with Homozygous Hypercholesterolemia on Lipoprotein Apheresis (CHAIN). An overall cohort included patients diagnosed with HoFH aged 0-18 years who were alive and in follow-up between Jan 1, 2010, and Nov 8, 2021, and whose high plasma LDL cholesterol concentrations made them eligible for lipoprotein apheresis. To compare cardiovascular outcomes, patients who initiated lipoprotein apheresis in childhood (lipoprotein apheresis group) and patients who only received lipid-lowering drugs (pharmacotherapy-only group) were matched by sex and untreated plasma LDL cholesterol concentrations. The primary outcome was a composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, ischaemic stroke, percutaneous coronary intervention, coronary artery bypass grafting, aortic valve replacement, peripheral artery disease, carotid endarterectomy, angina pectoris, and supra-aortic or aortic stenosis (collectively referred to as atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease), for which survival analyses were performed in the matched cohort. Cox regression analyses were used to compare disease-free survival between cohorts and to calculate hazard ratio (HR) and 95% CI adjusted for sex, age at diagnosis, untreated plasma LDL cholesterol concentration, and number of lipid-lowering therapies other than lipoprotein apheresis. The overall cohort included 404 patients with a median age at diagnosis of 6·0 years (IQR 3·0-9·5) and median untreated plasma LDL cholesterol of 17·8 mmol/L (14·7-20·8). The matched cohorts included 250 patients (125 patients per group), with a median untreated LDL cholesterol of 17·2 mmol/L (14·8-19·7). Mean reduction in plasma LDL cholesterol concentrations between baseline and final follow-up was greater in the lipoprotein apheresis group (-55% [95% CI -60 to -51] vs -31% [-36 to -25]; p<0·0001). Patients in the lipoprotein apheresis group had longer atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease-free survival (adjusted HR 0·52 [95% CI 0·32-0·85]) and longer cardiovascular death-free survival (0·0301 [0·0021-0·4295]). Cardiovascular death was more common in the pharmacotherapy-only group than in the lipoprotein apheresis group (ten [8%] vs one [1%]; p=0·010), whereas median age at coronary artery bypass grafting was lower in the lipoprotein apheresis group than in the pharmacotherapy-only group (15·0 years [IQR 12·0-24·0] vs 30·5 years [19·0-33·8]; p=0·037). Among patients with HoFH, lipoprotein apheresis initiated during childhood and adolescence is associated with reduced long-term risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and death, and clear benefits of early initiation of high-frequency treatment on reducing plasma cholesterol were found. Consensus recommendations are now needed to guide more widespread and timely use of lipoprotein apheresis for children with HoFH, and research is required to further optimise treatment and ensure benefits of early and aggressive treatment delivery are balanced against effects on quality of life.

            "ID: 38759515, Title: Mechanoresponsive ETS1 causes endothelial dysfunction and arterialization in varicose veins via NOTCH4/DLL4 signaling., Abstract: Varicose veins are the most common venous disorder in humans and are characterized by hemodynamic instability due to valvular insufficiency and orthostatic lifestyle factors. It is unclear how changes in biomechanical signals cause aberrant remodeling of the vein wall. Our previous studies suggest that Notch signaling is implicated in varicose vein arterialization. In the arterial system, mechanoresponsive ETS1 is a transcriptional activator of the endothelial Notch, but its involvement in sensing disrupted venous flow and varicose vein formation has not been investigated. Here, we use human varicose veins and cultured human venous endothelial cells to show that disturbed venous shear stress activates ETS1-NOTCH4/DLL4 signaling. Notch components were highly expressed in the neointima, whereas ETS1 was upregulated in all histological layers of varicose veins. In vitro microfluidic flow-based studies demonstrate that even minute changes in venous flow patterns enhance ETS1-NOTCH4/DLL4 signaling. Uniform venous shear stress, albeit an inherently low-flow system, does not induce ETS1 and Notch proteins. ETS1 activation under altered flow was mediated primarily by MEK1/2 and, to a lesser extent, by MEK5 but was independent of p38 MAP kinase. Endothelial cell-specific ETS1 knockdown prevented disturbed flow-induced NOTCH4/DLL4 expression. TK216, an inhibitor of ETS-family, prevented the acquisition of arterial molecular identity and loss of endothelial integrity in cells exposed to the ensuing altered shear stress. We conclude that ETS1 senses blood flow disturbances and may promote venous remodeling by inducing endothelial dysfunction. Targeting ETS1 rather than downstream Notch proteins could be an effective and safe strategy to develop varicose vein therapies.\n",

While HFpEF can be derived from several different etiologies, much of the current growth in the disease is being driven by metabolic dysfunction (e.g. obesity, diabetes, hypertension). Deleterious changes in mitochondrial energy metabolism are a common feature of HFpEF, and may help to drive the progression of the disease. In this brief article we aim to review various aspects of cardiac mitochondrial dysfunction in HFpEF, discuss the emerging topic of HFpEF-driven mitochondrial dysfunction in tissues beyond the heart, and examine whether supporting mitochondrial function may be a therapeutic approach to arrest or reverse disease development.\n",
            "ID: 38759418, Title: Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors attenuate vascular calcification by suppressing endoplasmic reticulum protein thioredoxin domain containing 5 dependent osteogenic reprogramming., Abstract: Vascular calcification is strongly linked to the development of major adverse cardiovascular events, but effective treatments are lacking. Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are an emerging category of oral hypoglycemic drugs that have displayed marked effects on metabolic and cardiovascular diseases, including recently reported vascular medial calcification. However, the roles and underlying mechanisms of SGLT2 inhibitors in vascular calcification have not been fully elucidated. Thus, we aimed to further determine whether SGLT2 inhibitors protect against vascular calcification and to investigate the mechanisms involved. A computed tomography angiography investigation of coronary arteries from 1554 patients with type 2 diabetes revealed that SGLT2 inhibitor use was correlated with a lower Agatston calcification score. In the vitamin D3 overdose, 5/6 nephrectomy chronic kidney disease-induced medial calcification and Western diet-induced atherosclerotic intimal calcification models, dapagliflozin (DAPA) substantially alleviated vascular calcification in the aorta. Furthermore, we showed that DAPA reduced vascular calcification via Runx2-dependent osteogenic transdifferentiation in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Transcriptome profiling revealed that thioredoxin domain containing 5 (TXNDC5) was involved in the attenuation of vascular calcification by DAPA. Rescue experiments showed that DAPA-induced TXNDC5 downregulation in VSMCs blocked the protective effect on vascular calcification. Furthermore, TXNDC5 downregulation disrupted protein folding-dependent Runx2 stability and promoted subsequent proteasomal degradation. Moreover, DAPA downregulated TXNDC5 expression via amelioration of oxidative stress and ATF6-dependent endoplasmic reticulum stress. Consistently, the class effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on vascular calcification were validated with empagliflozin in intimal and medial calcification models. SGLT2 inhibitors ameliorate vascular calcification through blocking endoplasmic reticulum stress-dependent TXNDC5 upregulation and promoting subsequent Runx2 proteasomal degradation, suggesting that SGLT2 inhibitors are potentially beneficial for vascular calcification treatment and prevention.\n",
            "ID: 38759318, Title: JinLiDa granules alleviates cardiac hypertrophy and inflammation in diabetic cardiomyopathy by regulating TP53., Abstract: JinLiDa granules (JLD) is a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus with Qi and Yin deficiency. Clinical evidence has shown that JLD can alleviate diabetic cardiomyopathy, but the exact mechanism is not yet clear. The purpose of this study was to examine the potential role and mechanism of JLD in the treatment of diabetic cardiomyopathy through network pharmacological analysis and basic experiments. The targets of JLD associated with diabetic cardiomyopathy were examined by network pharmacology. Protein interaction analysis was performed on the targets, and the associated pathways were searched by Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis. Diabetic mice were treated with low or high doses of JLD by gavage, and AC16 and H9C2 cardiomyocytes exposed to high-glucose conditions were treated with JLD. The analysis results were verified by various experimental techniques to examine molecular mechanisms. Network pharmacological analysis revealed that JLD acted on the tumor suppressor p53 (TP53) during inflammation and fibrosis associated with diabetic cardiomyopathy. The results of basic experiments showed that after JLD treatment, ventricular wall thickening in diabetic mouse hearts was attenuated, cardiac hypertrophy and myocardial inflammation were alleviated, and the expression of cardiac hypertrophy- and inflammation-related factors in cardiomyocytes exposed to a high-glucose environment was decreased. Cardiomyocyte morphology also improved after JLD treatment. TP53 expression and the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGFβ1) signaling pathways were significantly altered, and inhibiting TP53 expression effectively alleviated the activation of the TNF and TGFβ1 signaling pathways under high glucose conditions. Overexpression of TP53 activated these signaling pathways. JLD acted on TP53 to regulate the TNF and TGFβ1 signaling pathways, effectively alleviating cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and inflammation in high glucose and diabetic conditions. Our study provides a solid foundation for the future treatment of diabetic cardiomyopathy with JLD.\n",

The bioactive ingredients of HKC mainly include the flavonoids such as rutin, hyperoside, hibifolin, isoquercetin, myricetin, quercetin and quercetin-3-O-robinobioside. To explore the molecular mechanisms of A. manihot in treatment of DKD. A single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of kidneys in db/db mice with and without HKC administration. Urinary biochemical and histopathological examination in C57BL/6 and db/db mice of DKD and HKC groups was done. Single-cell RNA sequencing pipeline was then performed. The regulatory mechanisms of seven flavonoids in HKC were revealed by cell communication, prediction of transcription factor regulatory network, and molecular docking. By constructing ligand-receptor regulatory network and performing molecular docking between 75 receptors with different activities and seven flavonoids. 11 key receptors in 4 cell types (segment 3 proximal convoluted tubular cell, ascending limbs of the loop of Henle, distal convoluted tubule, and T cell) in kidneys were found to be directly interacted with HKC. The interactions regulated 8 downstream regulons. The docking receptors in T cell led to transcriptional event differences in the regulons such as Cebpb, Rel, Tbx21 and Klf2 and consequently affected the activation, differentiation, and infiltration of T cell, while the receptors Tgfbr1 and Ldlr in stromal cells of kidneys were closely associated with the downstream transcriptional events of renal injury and proteinuria in DKD. The current study provides novel information of the key receptors and regulons in renal cells for a better understanding of the cell type specific molecular mechanisms of A. manihot in treatment of DKD.\n",
            "ID: 38759226, Title: Diagnosis and Management of Periprosthetic Joint Infections After Total Ankle Arthroplasty., Abstract: Periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) after total ankle arthroplasty (TAA) is a dreaded complication that may lead to catastrophic outcomes. Risk factors include a history of surgery on the operated ankle, low preoperative function scores, diabetes, extended surgical time, and postoperative wound-healing problems. Clinical presentation varies and may include increasing ankle pain and swelling, high temperature, local erythema, wound drainage, and dehiscence. The initial diagnostic evaluation should include plain radiographs, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein levels, and leukocyte count. In suspected cases with elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein, aspiration of the ankle joint for synovial fluid analysis, Gram staining, and culture should be performed. Antibiotic therapy should be based on the pathogen identified, and the surgical strategy should be determined based on the time lines of PJI. Early PJI can be treated with irrigation and débridement with polyethylene exchange. The surgical treatment of choice for late PJI is two-stage revision arthroplasty, which includes removal of the implant, insertion of an antibiotic spacer, and reimplantation of a TAA. In certain chronic PJI cases, permanent articulating antibiotic spacers can be left in place or an ankle arthrodesis can be performed. Below-knee amputation is considered as the final option after limb-sparing procedures have failed.\n",
            "ID: 38759099, Title: Clinical presentation, antimicrobial resistance, and treatment outcomes of Aeromonas human infections: A 14-year retrospective study and comparative genomics of two isolates from fatal cases., Abstract: Aeromonas virulence may not be entirely dependent on the host immune status. Pathophysiologic determinants of disease progression and severity remain unclear. One hundred five patients with Aeromonas infections and 112 isolates were identified, their clinical presentations and outcomes analyzed, and their antimicrobial resistance (AMR) patterns assessed. Two isolates (A and B) from fatal cases of Aeromonas dhakensis bacteremia were characterized using whole genome sequence analysis. Virulence factor- and AMR-encoding genes from these isolates were compared with a well-characterized diarrheal isolate A. dhakensis SSU, and environmental isolate A. hydrophila ATCC_7966T. Skin and soft tissue infections, traumatic wound infections, sepsis, burns, and intraabdominal infections were common. Diabetes, malignancy, and cirrhosis were frequent comorbidities. Male sex, age ≥ 65 years, hospitalization, burns, and intensive care were associated with complicated disease. High rates of AMR to carbapenems and piperacillin-tazobactam were found. Treatment failure was observed in 25.7% of cases. Septic shock and hospital-acquired infections were predictors of treatment failure. All four isolates harbored assorted broad-spectrum AMR genes including blaOXA, ampC, cphA, and efflux pumps. Only clinical isolates possessed both polar and lateral flagellar genes, genes for various surface adhesion proteins, type 3- and -6 secretion systems and their effectors, and toxin genes, including exotoxin A. Both isolates A and B were resistant to colistin and harbored the mobile colistin resistance-3 (mcr-3) gene. Empirical therapy tailored to local Aeromonas antibiograms may facilitate more favorable outcomes, while advanced diagnostic methods may aid in identifying correct Aeromonas spp. of significant clinical importance.\n",
            "ID: 38758937, Title: The effect of calcaneus and metatarsal head offloading insoles on healthy subjects' gait kinematics, kinetics, asymmetry, and the implications for plantar pressure management: A pilot study., Abstract: The global number of people with diabetes is estimated to reach 643 million by 2030 of whom 19-34% will present with diabetic foot ulceration. Insoles which offload high-risk ulcerative regions on the foot, by removing insole material, are the main contemporary conservative treatment to maintain mobility and reduce the likelihood of ulceration. However, their effect on the rest of the foot and relationship with key gait propulsive and balance kinematics and kinetics has not been well researched. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of offloading insoles on gait kinematics, kinetics, and plantar pressure throughout the gait cycle. 10 healthy subjects were recruited for this experiment to walk in 6 different insole conditions. Subjects walked at three speeds on a treadmill for 10 minutes while both plantar pressure and gait kinematics, kinetics were measured using an in-shoe pressure measurement insole and motion capture system/force plates. Average peak plantar pressure, pressure time integrals, gait kinematics and centre of force were analysed. The average peak plantar pressure and pressure time integrals changed by -30% (-68% to 3%) and -36% (-75% to -1%) at the region of interest when applying offloading insoles, whereas the heel strike and toe-off velocity changed by 15% (-6% to 32%) and 12% (-2% to 19%) whilst walking at three speeds. The study found that offloading insoles reduced plantar pressure in the region of interest with loading transferred to surrounding regions increasing the risk of higher pressure time integrals in these locations. Heel strike and toe-off velocities were increased under certain configurations of offloading insoles which may explain the higher plantar pressures and supporting the potential of integrating kinematic gait variables within a more optimal therapeutic approach. However, there was inter-individual variability in responses for all variables measured supporting individualised prescription.\n",
            "ID: 38758936, Title: Bacteriological analysis and antibiotic resistance in patients with diabetic foot ulcers in Dhaka., Abstract: The primary objective of this study was to isolate bacteria from diabetic foot ulcers and subsequently assess their antibiotic resistance capabilities. Seventy-five patients diagnosed with diabetic foot ulcers were investigated. A number of these patients (97.33%) had type 2 diabetes, with a significant proportion of them having been diagnosed for 1-5 years (29.33%). Notably, a substantial number of these individuals were on insulin usage (78.66%). Among the patients under examination, 49.33% reported having no use of tobacco products, alcohol, or betel leaf. The ulcers analyzed in this study were classified into grades 1-5 according to the Wagner scale. Wagner grade 2 diabetic foot ulcers had the highest number of culture-positive patients, at 33.33%. Pus samples collected from patients were cultured on selective media, and bacterial identity was confirmed by biochemical tests and polymerase chain reaction. A total of 141 isolates were isolated. Among the isolates, 82.97% gram-negative bacteria and 17.02% gram-positive bacteria were detected. Klebsiella pneumoniae was the most common isolate. Proteus spp., Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus were also detected. Approximately 61.33% of the ulcers exhibited were polybacterial. In this study, it was observed that all bacterial isolates, except for Proteus spp., were primarily detected in patients classified under Wagner's grade 2. Moreover, antibiotic susceptibility was also tested on these 141 isolates. Among them, Escherichia coli showed the highest multidrug resistance, 81.81%. Most of the gram-negative bacteria were resistant to ampicillin. All of the gram-negative isolates exhibited high levels of susceptibility to piperacillin-tazobactam, and these levels were Klebsiella pneumoniae (97.56%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (95.24%), Escherichia coli (81.82%), and Proteus spp. (80%). On the other hand, gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus mostly showed sensitivity towards vancomycin and norfloxacin (79.17%).\n",
            "ID: 38758907, Title: Electrolyte disturbances in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 infection: An observational study., Abstract: There are multiple mechanisms by which The Coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) infection can cause electrolyte abnormalities, which may not be the case for bacterial causes of pneumonia. This study aimed to assess the differences in electrolyte levels between patients suffering from COVID-19 and bacterial pneumonia. This is an original, retrospective study. Two cohorts of hospitalized patients were included, 1 suffering from COVID-19 and the other from bacterial pneumonia. Their day 1 and day 3 levels of sodium, potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus, as well as their outcomes, were extracted from the charts. Statistical analysis was subsequently performed. Mean admission levels of sodium, potassium, phosphorus, and magnesium were 135.64 ± 6.13, 4.38 ± 0.69, 3.53 ± 0.69, and 2.03 ± 0.51, respectively. The mean day 3 levels of these electrolytes were 138.3 ± 5.06, 4.18 ± 0.59, 3.578 ± 0.59, and 2.11 ± 0.64, respectively. Patients suffering from bacterial pneumonia were significantly older (N = 219, mean = 64.88 ± 15.99) than patients with COVID-19 pneumonia (N = 240, mean = 57.63 ± 17.87). Bacterial pneumonia group had significantly higher serum potassium (N = 211, mean = 4.51 ± 0.76), and magnesium (N = 115, mean = 2.12 ± 0.60) levels compared to COVID-19 group (N = 227, mean = 4.254 ± 0.60 for potassium and N = 118, mean = 1.933 ± 0.38 for magnesium). Only magnesium was significantly higher among day 3 electrolytes in the bacterial pneumonia group. No significant association between electrolyte levels and outcomes was seen. We found that COVID-19 patients had lower potassium and magnesium levels on admission, possibly due to the effect of COVID-19 on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system as well as patient characteristics and management. We did not find enough evidence to recommend using electrolyte levels as a determinator of prognosis, but more research is needed.\n",
            "ID: 38758866, Title: Influence of continuous 4C nursing on quality of life and self-care ability of patients with diabetes retinopathy: An observational study., Abstract: This study aims to investigate the impact of continuous 4C nursing on patients with diabetes retinopathy (DR) and its influence on self-care ability. A total of 100 DR patients admitted to our hospital from October 2020 to October 2022 were randomly divided into a control group and an observation group, with 50 cases in each group. The control group received routine care, while the observation group received continuous 4C care. The nursing effects of both groups were compared. After nursing, the observation group showed a lower self-rating anxiety scale score and a higher self-care ability scale score compared to the control group (P < .05). The SQQL-VI scores for all social activities were also higher in the observation group (P < .05). Additionally, the observation group had lower levels of fasting blood glucose, 2-hour postprandial blood glucose, and glycated hemoglobin than the control group (P < .05). Moreover, the observation group had higher visual acuity and lower intraocular pressure than the control group (P < .05). The visual impairment rate was lower and the overall compliance rate was higher in the observation group compared to the control group (P < .05). After nursing, both groups showed improvements in symptoms, visual function, physical function, psychological and social activity scores, visual acuity, and patient satisfaction scores. The observation group showed greater improvements compared to the control group (P < .05). The application of continuous 4C nursing in DR patients has shown positive effects, including improved patient compliance and satisfaction, enhanced patient quality of life and visual acuity. These findings suggest that continuous 4C nursing should be widely promoted and applied in clinical practice.\n",
            "ID: 38758863, Title: Regulatory patterns of Chinese patent medicine for lipid metabolism disorders in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus complicated by ischemic stroke: A systematic review and network meta-analysis., Abstract: To investigate the regulatory patterns of Chinese patent medicine (CPM) interventions on lipid metabolism disorders in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) complicated by ischemic stroke. Two researchers independently searched 8 major databases and created a comprehensive database containing all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that investigated the application of \"blood-activating and stasis-removing\" CPM in the treatment of stroke combined with T2DM until October 1, 2022. The collected data were compiled and organized in Excel. Quality assessment was performed using the Cochrane 5.3 bias risk assessment tool, and the network meta-analysis was conducted using R software. A total of 12 articles were included in the final analysis, covering 4 types of CPM: Naoxintong Capsules (NXT), Tongmai Jiangtang Capsules, Tongxinluo Capsules (TXL), and Yindan Xinnaotong Soft Capsules. Among these, CPM formulations containing herbs with blood-activating and stasis-removing properties were the most commonly used. The results of the network meta-analysis are as follows: (1) the combination of 3 CPM formulations showed superior efficacy in improving total cholesterol levels compared to conventional Western medicine treatment (CT). In particular, Yindan Xinnaotong Soft Capsules + CT (surface under the cumulative ranking curve [SUCRA] = 97.24%) demonstrated the highest efficacy, followed by NXT + CT (SUCRA = 66.23%), and then TXL + CT (SUCRA = 55.16%). (2) TXL + CT treatment exhibited the most promising efficacy in improving triglyceride levels (P < .05), while the effects of the other 3 CPM formulations were not statistically significant. (3) In terms of improving low-density lipoprotein levels, NXT + CT (SUCRA = 82.27%) showed better efficacy than TXL + CT (SUCRA = 73.99%), while the effects of the other 2 CPM formulations were not statistically significant. (4) The combination of CPM formulations and CT resulted in a lower incidence of adverse reactions compared to CT (P < .05). The treatment of patients with T2DM complicated by ischemic stroke commonly involved the use of \"blood-activating and stasis-removing\" herbal medicines. These herbal medicines have shown effectiveness in regulating patients' blood lipid levels. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that the analysis was influenced by variations in the number and quality of RCTs involving different CPM formulations. Therefore, additional validation through large-scale, high-quality RCT studies is required.\n",
            "ID: 38758855, Title: Incretin-based drugs decrease the incidence of prostate cancer in type 2 diabetics: A pooling-up analysis., Abstract: Incretin-based drugs, a class of Antidiabetic medications (ADMs) used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, may affect the incidence of prostate cancer (PCa). But real-world evidence for this possible effect is lacking. Therefore, the aim of this study is to assess the effect of incretin-based drugs on the incidence of PCa, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors. We searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases for eligible studies through September 2023. Two independent reviewers performed screening and data extraction. We used the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) to assess the quality of included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cohort studies. We did a meta-analysis of available trial data to calculate overall risk ratios (RRs) for PCa. A total of 1238 articles were identified in our search. After screening for eligibility, 7 high-quality studies met the criteria for meta-analysis, including 2 RCTs and 5 cohort studies, with a total of 1165,738 patients. Compared with the control group, we found that incretin-based drugs reduced the relative risk of PCa by 35% (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.17-0.49; P = .0006). In subgroup analysis, the RR values for GLP-1 receptor agonists and DPP-4 inhibitors were 62% (95% CI, 0.45-0.85; P = .003) and 72% (95% CI, 0.46-1.12; P = .14), respectively. Incretin-based drugs are associated with lower incidence of prostate cancer and may have a preventive effect on prostate cancer in patients with type 2 diabetes.\n",
            "ID: 38758848, Title: Limb salvage and systemic management of gouty tophi: Case series., Abstract: Gout is a chronic disease characterized by deposition of monosodium urate crystals. Tophi develop in some individuals with untreated or uncontrolled gout, which leads to ulcerations, cosmetic problems, mechanical obstruction of joint movement, joint damage and musculoskeletal disability. Currently, the treatment of gouty tophi is controversial and challenging. Both surgical and internal medical treatments have limitations and require further exploration in clinical practice. In Case 1, we treated a patient with severe infection of diabetic foot ulcers with concomitant multiple gouty tophi in the same limb. A systematic management strategy was formulated to close the wound and save the limb. The ulcers healed successfully after half a year. In Case 2, a giant gouty tophi located in the first metatarsophalangeal joint of the left foot was removed by surgical treatment and vancomycin-loaded bone cement implantation. In Case 3, we present a case of gouty tophi that was resolved by standardized systemic medical management. Three patients were all diagnosed with gout accompanied by gouty deposition, although there were other different comorbidities. In case 1, we used debridement to gradually remove gouty tophi. In case 2, the giant gouty tophi was removed by surgical operation. In case 3, the gouty tophi disappeared after standardized treatment with medicine, diet and lifestyle management. Three patients underwent different treatment therapies to remove gouty tophi based on their specific conditions. We explored effective interventions for tophi in gout by surgical or other interventions in combination with pharmacotherapy.\n",
            "ID: 38758847, Title: Evaluation of adverse reactions induced by anti-tuberculosis drugs among hospitalized patients in Wuhan, China: A retrospective study., Abstract: The study aims to estimate the incidence and risk factors of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) induced by anti-tuberculosis (TB) drugs. A single center retrospective analysis of patients taking anti-TB therapy from January 2016 to December 2018 in the hospital was conducted. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis were used to identify these risk factors of ADRs induced by anti-TB drugs. Among 1430 patients receiving anti-TB therapy, 440 (30.77%) patients showed at least 1 ADR induced by anti-TB drugs. Hyperuricemia was the most common ADR, followed by hepatic function test abnormality, liver damage and gastrointestinal reactions. Significant differences (P < .05) were also seen in diabetes, age, treatment duration, type of TB (extrapulmonary) and some therapeutic regimens between ADR group and non-ADR group, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that treatment duration (OR = 1.029, 95%CI[1.018-1.040], P = .000), type of TB (extrapulmonary, OR = 1.487, 95%CI[1.134-1.952], P = .004) and some therapeutic regimens (HREZ, OR = 1.425, 95%CI[0.922-2.903], P = .001; HRZS, OR = 2.063, 95% CI[1.234-3.449], P = .006; HRZ, OR = 3.623, 95%CI[2.289-5.736], P = .000) were risk factors for ADRs induced by anti-TB drugs. Anti-TB drugs usually induced the occurrence of severe and frequent adverse effects, such as hyperuricemia. Treatment duration, HREZ, HRZS and HRZ regimens, and type of TB (extrapulmonary) should be considered as high-risk factors. Thus, it should be recommended to consider optimum management during anti-TB therapy, particularly hyperuricemia monitoring and hepatic function test.\n",
            "ID: 38758689, Title: A Comparison of Adverse Short-Term Outcomes After Forefoot Amputation Based on Patient Height., Abstract: The objective of this investigation was to evaluate adverse short-term outcomes after partial forefoot amputation with a specific comparison performed based on patient height. The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database was analyzed to select patients with a 28805 Current Procedural Terminology code (amputation, foot; transmetatarsal) who underwent the procedure with \"all layers of incision (deep and superficial) fully closed.\" This resulted in 11 patients with a height of 60 inches or less, 202 with a height greater than 60 inches and less than 72 inches, and 55 with a height of 72 inches or greater. Results of the primary outcome measures found no significant differences among groups with respect to the development of a superficial surgical site infection (0% versus 6.4% versus 5.5%; P = .669), deep incisional infection (9.1% versus 3.5% versus 10.9%; P = .076), or wound disruption (0% versus 5.4% versus 5.5%; P = .730). In addition, no significant differences were observed among groups with respect to unplanned reoperations (9.1% versus 16.8% versus 12.7%; P = .630) or unplanned hospital readmissions (45.5% versus 23.3% versus 20.0%; P = .190). The results of this investigation demonstrate no differences in short-term adverse outcomes after partial forefoot amputation with primary closure based on patient height. Although height has previously been described as a potential risk factor in the development of lower-extremity pathogenesis, this finding was not observed in this study from a large US database.\n",
            "ID: 38758687, Title: Association of Preulcerative Foot Care and Outcomes of Diabetic Foot Ulceration., Abstract: The purpose of this study was to determine the association of preulcerative foot care and outcomes of diabetic foot ulcerations (DFUs). This retrospective cohort study using the Mariner all-payers claims data set included participants with a new DFU from 2010 to 2019. Patients were stratified into two cohorts (foot care and control) based on whether they had received any outpatient foot care within 12 months before DFU. Adjusted comparison was performed by propensity matching for age, sex, and the Charlson Comorbidity Index (1:2 ratio). Kaplan-Meier estimates and logistic regression examined the association between foot care and outcomes of DFUs. Of the 307,131 patients in the study cohort, 4.7% (n = 14,477) received outpatient preulcerative foot care within the 12-month period before DFU. The rate of major amputation was 1.8% (foot care, 1.2%), and 9.0% of patients had hospitalizations for foot infection within 12 months after DFU (foot care, 7.8%). In the study cohort, patients who received pre-DFU foot care had greater major amputation-free survival (P < .001) on Kaplan-Meier estimate. In both the study and matched cohorts, multivariable analysis demonstrated that foot care was associated with lower odds of major amputation for both study (odds ratio [OR], 0.56; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.48-0.66) and matched (OR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.51-0.72) cohorts, and lower odds of hospitalizations for a foot infection in both study (OR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.86-0.96) and matched (OR, 0.88, 95% CI, 0.82-0.94) cohorts. Among patients with a new DFU, those who received outpatient preulcerative foot care within 12 months of diagnosis had lower risks of major amputation and hospitalizations for foot infection.\n",
            "ID: 38758679, Title: Effectiveness of Peripheral Nerve Block in Terms of Search for a Standardized Treatment Protocol in Diabetic Foot Patients Using Anticoagulants: A Double-Center Study., Abstract: Lower-extremity amputation for a diabetic foot is mainly performed under general or central neuraxial anesthesia. Ultrasound-guided peripheral nerve block (PNB) can be a good alternative, especially for patients who require continuous anticoagulation treatment and patients with additional comorbidities. We evaluated bleeding due to PNB application in patients with diabetic foot receiving antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy. Perioperative morbidity and mortality and the need for intensive care hospitalization were analyzed. This study included 105 patients with diabetic foot or debridement who underwent distal foot amputation or debridement between February and October 2020. Popliteal nerve block (17 mL of 5% bupivacaine and 3 mL of saline) and saphenous nerve block (5 mL of 2% lidocaine) were applied to the patients. Postoperative pain scores (at 4, 8, 12, and 24 hours) and complications due to PNB were evaluated. Intensive care admission and 1-month mortality were recorded. The most common diseases accompanying diabetes were hypertension and peripheral artery disease. No complications due to PNB were observed. Mean ± SD postoperative first analgesic need was determined to be 14.1 ± 4.1 hours. Except for one patient, this group was followed up without the need for postoperative intensive care. In 16 patients, bleeding occurred as leakage from the surgical area, and it was stopped with repeated pressure dressing. Mean ± SD patient satisfaction score was 8.36 ± 1.59. Perioperative mortality was not observed. Ultrasound-guided PNB can be an effective and safe anesthetic technique for diabetic patients undergoing distal foot amputation, especially those receiving antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy and considered high risk.\n",
            "ID: 38758678, Title: Postoperative Opioid-Prescribing Practice in Limb Preservation Surgery., Abstract: Limb preservation surgery affects more than 100,000 Americans annually. Current postoperative pain management prescribing practices of podiatric physicians in the United States are understudied. We examined prescribing practices for limb preservation surgery to identify prescriber characteristics' that may be associated with postoperative opioid-prescribing practices. We administered an anonymous online questionnaire consisting of five patient scenarios with limb preservation surgery commonly performed by podiatric physicians. Respondents provided information about their prescription choice for each surgery. Basic provider demographics were collected. We developed linear regression models to identify the strength and direction of association between prescriber characteristics and quantity of postoperative opioid \"pills\" (dosage units) prescribed at surgery. Logistic regression models were used to identify the odds of prescribing opioids for each scenario. One hundred fifteen podiatric physicians completed the survey. Podiatric physicians reported using regional nerve blocks 70% to 88% of the time and prescribing opioids 43% to 67% of the time across all scenarios. Opioids were more commonly prescribed than nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and anticonvulsants. Practicing in the Northeast United States was a significant variable in linear regression (P = .009, a decrease of 9-10 dosage units) and logistic regression (odds ratio, 0.23; 95% confidence interval, 0.07-0.68; P = .008) models for the transmetatarsal amputation scenario. Prescribing practice variation exists in limb preservation surgery by region. Podiatric physicians reported using preoperative regional nerve blocks more than prescribing postoperative opioids for limb preservation surgeries. Through excess opioid prescribing, the diabetes pandemic has likely contributed to the US opioid epidemic. Podiatric physicians stand at the intersection of these two public health crises and are equipped to reduce their impact via preventive foot care and prescribing nonopioid analgesics when warranted.\n",
            "ID: 38758675, Title: Rate and Location of Reulceration and Reamputation After Partial First-Ray Amputation versus Hallux Amputation in Diabetic and Nondiabetic Populations., Abstract: We sought to determine the rates of reulceration and reamputation in individuals who underwent partial first-ray amputations versus hallux amputations in diabetic and nondiabetic populations. Eighty-four amputations were reviewed in a retrospective fashion. A retrospective medical record review was performed to determine patients who underwent a hallux amputation, both partial and complete, and patients who underwent a partial first-ray amputation. Only patients from 2007 to 2019 were reviewed. The reulceration rate of hallux amputations was 61% compared with a partial first-ray amputation reulceration rate of 74%. The reamputation rate of hallux amputation versus partial first-ray amputation was 43% versus 51%. At final follow-up, it was statistically significant that patients who underwent hallux amputation were more likely to be healed than those who underwent partial first-ray amputation, regardless of reulceration or reamputation. In addition, patients who underwent hallux amputation went on to digital amputation, and those who underwent partial first-ray amputation went on to transmetatarsal amputation. Comparing partial first-ray amputation to hallux amputation, hallux amputation patients are more prone to subsequent digital ulceration. Patients who initially undergo hallux amputation have variable subsequent amputations, often digital. Reulceration primarily occurs at the incision site for partial first-ray amputations, with a higher likelihood of subsequent transmetatarsal amputation. Patients with a medical history of diabetes and staged procedures are more likely to receive partial first-ray amputations. However, hallux amputation patients have a lower risk of reulceration and reamputation, regardless of subsequent events. These findings underscore the importance of discussing risks and preventive measures with patients undergoing such amputations, emphasizing postoperative examinations for specific areas of concern. Hallux amputation appears to offer greater protection against reulceration and reamputation for both diabetic and nondiabetic populations.\n",
            "ID: 38758674, Title: The Utility of Advanced Lower-Extremity Duplex Using Pedal Acceleration Time in the Management of the Threatened Diabetic Foot., Abstract: Patients with diabetes and diffuse infrageniculate arterial disease who present with chronic limb-threatening ischemia require an exact anatomical plan for revascularization. Advanced pedal duplex can be used to define possible routes for revascularization. In addition, pedal acceleration time (PAT) can predict the success or failure of both medical and surgical interventions. A retrospective review of patients who were referred to our group for unilateral limb-threatening ischemia with isolated infrageniculate disease was conducted. Pedal duplex and PAT at the base of the wound was performed before and 1 week after intervention. The primary endpoint was limb salvage at 1 year. Revascularization was defined as direct or indirect based on the angiosome concept. Fifty-four patients meeting inclusion criteria presented over a 5-year period (toe wound, n = 42; heel wound, n = 8; both, n = 4). At 1 year, 10 (18.5%) had required below-knee amputation, whereas the remainder had healed/improved. Limb salvage was predicted by absence of ongoing smoking, absence of dialysis, and postprocedural PAT (class I/II). Limb salvage did not correlate with direct versus indirect revascularization. Advanced lower-extremity duplex in conjunction with determining PAT at the area of concern is a useful technique for mapping the vasculature and identifying targets for revascularization in patients with diffuse infrageniculate disease. Target artery revascularization to the wound bed resulting in a PAT less than 180 msec is predictive of limb salvage, regardless of whether perfusion is direct or indirect.\n",
            "ID: 38758639, Title: Intraretinal Hyper-Reflective Foci Are Almost Universally Present and Co-Localize With Intraretinal Fluid in Diabetic Macular Edema., Abstract: In diabetic macular edema (DME), hyper-reflective foci (HRF) has been linked to disease severity and progression. Using an automated approach, we aimed to investigate the baseline distribution of HRF in DME and their co-localization with cystoid intraretinal fluid (IRF). Baseline spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) volume scans (N = 1527) from phase III clinical trials YOSEMITE (NCT03622580) and RHINE (NCT03622593) were segmented using a deep-learning-based algorithm (developed using B-scans from BOULEVARD NCT02699450) to detect HRF. The HRF count and volume were assessed. HRF distributions were analyzed in relation to best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), central subfield thickness (CST), and IRF volume in quartiles, and Diabetic Retinopathy Severity Scores (DRSS) in groups. Co-localization of HRF with IRF was calculated in the central 3-mm diameter using the en face projection. HRF were present in most patients (up to 99.7%). Median (interquartile range [IQR]) HRF volume within the 3-mm diameter Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study ring was 1964.3 (3325.2) pL, and median count was 64.0 (IQR = 96.0). Median HRF volumes were greater with decreasing BCVA (nominal P = 0.0109), and increasing CST (nominal P < 0.0001), IRF (nominal P < 0.0001), and DRSS up to very severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (nominal P < 0.0001). HRF co-localized with IRF in the en face projection. Using automated HRF segmentation of full SD-OCT volumes, we observed that HRF are a ubiquitous feature in DME and exhibit relationships with BCVA, CST, IRF, and DRSS, supporting a potential link to disease severity. The spatial distribution of HRF closely followed that of IRF.\n",
            "ID: 38758551, Title: Long-Term Outcomes Associated With β-Lactam Allergies., Abstract: β-lactam (BL) allergies are the most common drug allergy worldwide, but most are reported in error. BL allergies are also well-established risk factors for adverse drug events and antibiotic-resistant infections during inpatient health care encounters, but the understanding of the long-term outcomes of patients with BL allergies remains limited. To evaluate the long-term clinical outcomes of patients with BL allergies. This longitudinal retrospective cohort study was conducted at a single regional health care system in western Pennsylvania. Electronic health records were analyzed for patients who had an index encounter with a diagnosis of sepsis, pneumonia, or urinary tract infection between 2007 and 2008. Patients were followed-up until death or the end of 2018. Data analysis was performed from January 2022 to January 2024. The presence of any BL class antibiotic in the allergy section of a patient's electronic health record, evaluated at the earliest occurring observed health care encounter. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality, derived from the Social Security Death Index. Secondary outcomes were defined using laboratory and microbiology results and included infection with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Clostridium difficile, or vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) and severity and occurrence of acute kidney injury (AKI). Generalized estimating equations with a patient-level panel variable and time exposure offset were used to evaluate the odds of occurrence of each outcome between allergy groups. A total of 20 092 patients (mean [SD] age, 62.9 [19.7] years; 12 231 female [60.9%]), of whom 4211 (21.0%) had BL documented allergy and 15 881 (79.0%) did not, met the inclusion criteria. A total of 3513 patients (17.5%) were Black, 15 358 (76.4%) were White, and 1221 (6.0%) were another race. Using generalized estimating equations, documented BL allergies were not significantly associated with the odds of mortality (odds ratio [OR], 1.02; 95% CI, 0.96-1.09). BL allergies were associated with increased odds of MRSA infection (OR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.36-1.53), VRE infection (OR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.05-1.32), and the pooled rate of the 3 evaluated antibiotic-resistant infections (OR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.30-1.36) but were not associated with C difficile infection (OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.94-1.16), stage 2 and 3 AKI (OR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.96-1.10), or stage 3 AKI (OR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.98-1.14). Documented BL allergies were not associated with the long-term odds of mortality but were associated with antibiotic-resistant infections. Health systems should emphasize accurate allergy documentation and reduce unnecessary BL avoidance.\n",
            "ID: 38758517, Title: Improvement in Central Serous Chorioretinopathy Following Multiwavelength Photobiomodulation Treatment - Case Report., Abstract: Central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR) is a condition where fluid build-up accumulates underneath the retina, resulting in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) detachment and vision loss. Irreversible retinal functional and anatomical changes are possible consequences. Research into novel strategies to aid in recovery are of interest. Photobiomodulation (PBM) uses light wavelengths to improve cellular function and shows positive effects in several conditions including those with edema. This prospective case report details a 39-year-old woman with CSCR. Multiwavelength PBM treatment was initiated with the Valeda® Light Delivery System. A series of treatment included nine sessions delivered over 3-5 weeks. Follow-up treatments were conducted. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging and best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) measures were taken. The patient has been followed for approximately 1 year. The patient presented with blurred vision and a BCVA score of 65 letters in the left eye. After 3 weeks of observation, the patient's vision had further declined two lines on the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) chart to 55 letters. Fluorescein angiography was performed, confirming CSCR diagnosis, and PBM was initiated. PBM treatment improved BCVA and fluid build-up in the RPE within 1 week of treatment (three treatment sessions). Following the full series of treatment (nine PBM treatment sessions), fluid was completely resolved and BCVA scored at 80 letters. The patient had a repeat PBM treatment series ~ 6 months later and has shown stable vision and no fluid present on OCT scan. The patient was seen again ~ 1 year later with continued stable vision and no fluid detection. PBM is a non-invasive treatment option that may provide benefit in CSCR to resolve fluid build-up, macular change, and vision loss. Research into PBM as an immediate treatment option for CSCR, especially those with chronic presentations or those posed to have irreversible damage, is warranted to confirm effectiveness.\n",
            "ID: 38758435, Title: Mitochondria targeted esculetin administration improves insulin resistance and hyperglycemia-induced atherosclerosis in db/db mice., Abstract: The development and progression of hyperglycemia (HG) and HG-associated atherosclerosis are exacerbated by mitochondrial dysfunction due to dysregulated mitochondria-derived ROS generation. We recently synthesized a novel mitochondria-targeted esculetin (Mito-Esc) and tested its dose-response therapeutic efficacy in mitigating HG-induced atherosclerosis in db/db mice. In comparison to simvastatin and pioglitazone, Mito-Esc administration resulted in a considerable reduction in body weights and improved glucose homeostasis, possibly by reducing hepatic gluconeogenesis, as indicated by a reduction in glycogen content, non-esterified free fatty acids (NEFA) levels, and fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase) activity. Interestingly, Mito-Esc treatment, by regulating phospho-IRS and phospho-AKT levels, greatly improved palmitate-induced insulin resistance, resulting in enhanced glucose uptake in adipocytes and HepG2 cells. Also, and importantly, Mito-Esc administration prevented HG-induced atheromatous plaque formation and lipid accumulation in the descending aorta. In addition, Mito-Esc administration inhibited the HG-mediated increase in VACM, ICAM, and MAC3 levels in the aortic tissue, as well as reduced the serum pro-inflammatory cytokines and markers of senescence. In line with this, Mito-Esc significantly inhibited monocyte adherence to human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) treated with high glucose and reduced high glucose-induced premature senescence in HAECs by activating the AMPK-SIRT1 pathway. In contrast, Mito-Esc failed to regulate high glucose-induced endothelial cell senescence under AMPK/SIRT1-depleted conditions. Together, the therapeutic efficacy of Mito-Esc in the mitigation of hyperglycemia-induced insulin resistance and the associated atherosclerosis is in part mediated by potentiating the AMPK-SIRT1 axis. KEY MESSAGES: Mito-Esc administration significantly mitigates diabetes-induced atherosclerosis. Mito-Esc improves hyperglycemia (HG)-associated insulin resistance. Mito-Esc inhibits HG-induced vascular senescence and inflammation in the aorta. Mito-Esc-mediated activation of the AMPK-SIRT1 axis regulates HG-induced endothelial cell senescence.\n",
            "ID: 38758423, Title: Evaluation of the Factors Influencing Mortality in Patients with Stevens-Johnson Syndrome and Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis: A Multicenter Study of 166 Patients., Abstract: Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) are life-threatening acute mucocutaneous disorders usually triggered by drugs. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the factors affecting mortality in patients with SJS-TEN. Our study is a retrospective cohort study, analyzing data collected from a total of 12 tertiary care centers between April 2012 and April 2022. The study included 59 males and 107 females, a total of 166 patients, with an average age of 50.91 ± 21.25 years. Disease classification was TEN in 50% of cases, SJS in 33.1%, and SJS-TEN overlap in 16.9%. The average SCORTEN within the first 24 h was 2.44 ± 1.42. Supportive care was provided to 99.4% of patients. The most commonly used systemic immunomodulatory treatments were systemic steroids (84.3%), IVIG (intravenous immunoglobulin) (49.3%), and cyclosporine (38.6%). Plasmapheresis was administered to five patients. While 66.3% of patients were discharged, 24.1% resulted in exitus. Our comparative analysis of survivors and deceased patients found no effect of systemic steroids, IVIG, and cyclosporine treatments on mortality. Univariate analysis revealed that the SCORTEN scores on days 1 and 3 as well as the rates of detachment at the onset and during follow-up were significantly higher in deceased patients compared to survivors. The rates of fever, positive blood cultures, and systemic antibiotic use were higher in deceased patients compared to survivors. The presence of comorbidities, diabetes, and malignancy were significantly more common in deceased patients. Multivariate regression analysis indicated that over SCORTEN 2, the mortality risk exponentially rose with each SCORTEN increment, culminating in an 84-fold increase in mortality at SCORTEN 5-6 (odds ratio [95% confidence interval]: 13.902-507.537, p < 0.001) compared to SCORTEN 0-1. Additionally, the utilization of plasmapheresis was associated with a 22-fold increase in mortality (odds ratio [95% confidence interval]: 1.96-247.2, p = 0.012). Our study found that a high SCORTEN score within the first 24 h and the use of plasmapheresis were related to increased mortality, while systemic steroids, IVIG, and cyclosporine treatments had no impact on mortality. We believe that data gathered from one of the most comprehensive studies which we conducted on SJS-TEN will enrich the literature, although additional research is warranted.\n",
            "ID: 38758248, Title: Cardioprotective effects of vaccination in hospitalized patients with COVID-19., Abstract: COVID-19 vaccination has been shown to prevent and reduce the severity of COVID-19 disease. The aim of this study was to explore the cardioprotective effect of COVID-19 vaccination in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. In this retrospective, single-center cohort study, we included hospitalized COVID-19 patients with confirmed vaccination status from July 2021 to February 2022. We assessed outcomes such as acute cardiac events and cardiac biomarker levels through clinical and laboratory data. Our analysis covered 167 patients (69% male, mean age 58 years, 42% being fully vaccinated). After adjustment for confounders, vaccinated hospitalized COVID-19 patients displayed a reduced relative risk for acute cardiac events (RR: 0.33, 95% CI [0.07; 0.75]) and showed diminished troponin T levels (Cohen's d: - 0.52, 95% CI [- 1.01; - 0.14]), compared to their non-vaccinated peers. Type 2 diabetes (OR: 2.99, 95% CI [1.22; 7.35]) and existing cardiac diseases (OR: 4.31, 95% CI [1.83; 10.74]) were identified as significant risk factors for the emergence of acute cardiac events. Our findings suggest that COVID-19 vaccination may confer both direct and indirect cardioprotective effects in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.\n",
            "ID: 38758212, Title: Psychometric Properties of the Automated Insulin Delivery - Benefits and Burdens Scale (AID-BBS) for Adults with Type 1 Diabetes., Abstract: To evaluate the psychometric properties of a patient-reported outcome measure, The Automated Insulin Delivery - Benefits and Burdens Scale (AID-BBS), which was designed to assess benefits and burdens of AID use in adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D). The measure was hypothesized to have validity, reliability, and clinical utility for predicting likelihood of continued use of an AID system. 217 adults with T1D (ages 18 to 82 years) who were enrolled in an AID system research trial completed AID-BBS items at study midpoint (6 weeks) and at the end of the trial (13 weeks). Data were collected on pre-post glycemic outcomes. Participants completed other patient-reported psychosocial outcome measures (e.g., emotional well-being, diabetes distress, attitudes toward diabetes technology, diabetes treatment satisfaction) at Week 13. Likelihood of continued device use was assessed with three items at 13 weeks. Exploratory factor analysis supported a one-factor structure for each subscale (15-item benefit and 9-item burden subscale) when evaluated separately. Convergent, discriminant, and predictive validity, internal consistency, and test-retest reliability were supported. Benefit and burden subscales at week 6 predicted usage intention above and beyond device impact on glycemic outcomes, also controlling for baseline glycemic outcomes. Findings support the AID-BBS as a psychometrically valid, reliable, and useful instrument for assessing burdens and benefits associated with AID system use in adults with T1D. The measure can be used to help health care providers set realistic expectations and proactively address modifiable burdens.\n",
            "ID: 38758211, Title: Performance of subcutaneous continuous glucose monitoring in adult critically ill patients receiving vasopressor therapy., Abstract: Background Subcutaneous continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) may facilitate glucose control in the ICU. We aimed to assess the accuracy of CGM (Dexcom G6) against arterial blood glucose (ABG) in adult critically ill patients receiving intravenous insulin infusion and vasopressor therapy. We also aimed to assess feasibility and tolerability of CGM in this setting. Methods We included ICU patients receiving mechanical ventilation, insulin, and vasopressor therapy. Numerical accuracy was assessed by the mean absolute relative difference (MARD), overall, across arterial glucose strata, over different noradrenaline equivalent infusion rates, and over time since CGM start. MARD below 14% was considered acceptable. Clinical accuracy was assessed using Clarke Error Grid (CEG) analysis. Feasibility outcome included number and duration of interrupted sensor readings due to signal loss. Tolerability outcome included skin reactions related to sensor insertion or sensor adhesives. Results We obtained 2946 paired samples from 40 patients (18 with type 2 diabetes) receiving a median (IQR) maximum noradrenaline equivalent infusion rate of 0.18 (0.08-0.33) µg/kg/min during CGM. Overall, MARD was 12.7 (95% CI 10.7-15.3) % and 99.8% of CGM readings were within CEG zones A and B. MARD values ≥14% were observed when ABG was outside target range (6-10 mmol/l [108-180 mg/dl]) and with noradrenaline equivalent infusion rates above 0.10 µg/kg/min. Accuracy improved with time after CGM start, reaching MARD values below 14% after 36 hours. We observed four episodes of interrupted sensor readings due to signal loss ranging from 5 to 20 minutes. We observed no skin reactions related to sensor insertion or sensor adhesives. Conclusions In our ICU cohort of patients receiving vasopressor infusion, subcutaneous CGM demonstrated acceptable overall numerical and clinical accuracy. However, suboptimal accuracy may occur outside glucose ranges of 6-10 mmol/l (108-180 mg/dl), during higher dose vasopressor infusion, and during the first 36 hours after CGM start.\n",

            "ID: 38767051, Title: A novel radiomics-based technique for identifying vulnerable coronary plaques: a follow-up study., Abstract: Previous reports have suggested that coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA)-based radiomics analysis is a potentially helpful tool for assessing vulnerable plaques. We aimed to investigate whether coronary radiomic analysis of CCTA images could identify vulnerable plaques in patients with stable angina pectoris. This retrospective study included patients initially diagnosed with stable angina pectoris. Patients were randomly divided into either the training or test dataset at an 8 : 2 ratio. Radiomics features were extracted from CCTA images. Radiomics models for predicting vulnerable plaques were developed using the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm. The model performance was assessed using the area under the curve (AUC); the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were calculated to compare the diagnostic performance using the two cohorts. A total of 158 patients were included in the analysis. The SVM radiomics model performed well in predicting vulnerable plaques, with AUC values of 0.977 and 0.875 for the training and test cohorts, respectively. With optimal cutoff values, the radiomics model showed accuracies of 0.91 and 0.882 in the training and test cohorts, respectively. Although further larger population studies are necessary, this novel CCTA radiomics model may identify vulnerable plaques in patients with stable angina pectoris.\n",
            "ID: 38766996, Title: The ABCs of the 2023 AHA/ACC/ACCP/ASPC/NLA/PCNA guideline for the management of patients with chronic coronary disease., Abstract: The 2023 Multisociety Guideline for the Management of Chronic Coronary Disease (CCD) updates recommendations for CCD, formerly known as \"stable ischemic heart disease.\" This condition encompasses a spectrum of coronary vascular pathologies from subclinical to clinical ischemic heart disease. The new \"ABC\" mnemonic offers clinicians a streamlined framework for applying Class One Recommendations (COR1) and integrating recent updates into CCD management. A critical analysis of the 2023 CCD guidelines was conducted, with this review highlighting key elements. The review outlines crucial changes, including novel recommendations supported by current clinical evidence. The focus is on these developments, clarifying their importance for day-to-day clinical practice. The review encourages a synergistic approach between primary healthcare providers and cardiologists to develop comprehensive strategies for lifestyle modification and medication therapy in CCD care. Furthermore, it suggests that utilizing comprehensive risk assessment tools can refine medical decision-making, ultimately enhancing patient care and clinical outcomes.\n",
            "ID: 38766907, Title: Pembrolizumab-induced type 1 diabetes., Abstract: Immunotherapy has a crucial role in the current treatment of multiple malignancies. Albeit described as rare, new onset autoimmune diabetes is a potentially life-threatening complication of programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) inhibitors, such as pembrolizumab, and its predisposing factors and pathological mechanism are yet to be clarified. We present a case of a 72-year-old man with a high-grade bladder carcinoma undergoing pembrolizumab treatment. He had no personal or family history of diabetes mellitus but was diagnosed with primary hypothyroidism four months after starting pembrolizumab. Two years after starting pembrolizumab, he presented in the emergency department due to abdominal pain, anorexia, polydipsia, polyuria and vomiting over the preceding five days and he met criteria for severe diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Three days prior to his admission, he had received prednisolone therapy for suspected hypersensitivity related to a contrast-enhanced imaging that he performed. Prompt treatment for DKA was started, with transition to insulin basal-bolus therapy after DKA resolution, with progressive glycaemic stabilization. Further investigation revealed low C-peptide levels (0.07 ng/dL, with a fasting blood glucose of 288 mg/dL), HbA1c 9.2% and positive anti-IA2 antibodies, which allowed the diagnosis of new-onset autoimmune diabetes. Pembrolizumab was transiently suspended, and the patient resumed treatment after glycaemic profile optimization under multiple daily insulin administrations two months later. This case highlights the importance of clinical suspicion and glycaemic monitoring as an integral part of treatment protocols in patients on pembrolizumab and other immune checkpoint inhibitors. Additional research and investigation into the underlying mechanisms of this condition are necessary to identify potential screening tests for individuals at higher risk of developing DM and to guide the implementation of management and preventive strategies for ketoacidosis complication.\n",
            "ID: 38766839, Title: Apolipoprotein ɛ4 is associated with increased risk of fall- and fracture-related hospitalisation: the Perth Longitudinal Study of Ageing Women., Abstract: Apolipoprotein ɛ4 (APOE ɛ4) may be a genetic risk factor for reduced bone mineral density (BMD) and muscle function, which could have implications for fall and fracture risk. We examined the association between APOE ɛ4 status and long-term fall- and fracture-related hospitalisation risk in older women. 1276 community-dwelling women from the Perth Longitudinal Study of Ageing Women (mean age ± SD = 75.2 ± 2.7 years) were included. At baseline, women underwent APOE genotyping and detailed phenotyping for covariates including prevalent falls and fractures, as well as health and lifestyle factors. The association between APOE ɛ4 with fall-, any fracture-, and hip fracture-related hospitalisations, obtained over 14.5 years from linked health records, were examined using multivariable-adjusted Cox-proportional hazard models. Over 14.5 years, 507 (39.7%) women experienced a fall-related hospitalisation, 360 (28.2%) women experienced a fracture-related hospitalisation, including 143 (11.2%) attributed to a hip fracture. In multivariable-adjusted models, compared to non-carriers, APOE ɛ4 carriers (n=297, 23.3%) had greater risk for a fall- (HR 1.48 95%CI 1.22-1.81), fracture- (HR 1.28, 95%CI 1.01-1.63) or hip fracture-related hospitalisation (HR 1.83 95%CI 1.29-2.61). The estimates remained similar when specific fall and fracture risk factors (fear of falling, plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D, grip strength, timed-up-and-go, hip BMD, vitamin K status, prevalent diabetes, HbA1c, cholesterol, abbreviated mental test score) were added to the multivariable model. In conclusion, APOE ɛ4 is a potential risk factor for fall- and fracture-related hospitalisation in community-dwelling older women. Screening for APOE ɛ4 could provide clinicians an opportunity to direct higher risk individuals to appropriate intervention strategies.\n",
            "ID: 38766831, Title: Modern-Day Therapeutics and Ongoing Clinical Trials against Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: A Narrative Review., Abstract: Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is a global health concern that affects millions of people globally. The present review aims to narrate the clinical guidelines and therapeutic interventions for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) patients. Furthermore, the present work summarizes the ongoing phase 1/2/3 and clinical trials against T2DM. A meticulous and comprehensive literature review was performed using various databases, such as PubMed, MEDLINE, Clinical trials database (https://clinicaltrials.gov/), and Google Scholar, to include various clinical trials and therapeutic interventions against T2DM. Based on our findings, we concluded that most T2DM-associated clinical trials are interventional. Anti-diabetic therapeutics, including insulin, metformin, Dipeptidyl Peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor Agonists (GLP-1RAs), and Sodium- Glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors are frontline therapeutics being clinically investigated. Currently, the therapeutics in phase IV clinical trials are mostly SGLT-2 inhibitors, implicating their critical contribution to the clinical management of T2DM. Despite the success of T2DM treatments, a surge in innovative treatment options to reduce diabetic consequences and improve glycemic control is currently ongoing. More emphasis needs to be on exploring novel targeted drug candidates that can offer more sustained glycemic control.\n",
            "ID: 38766830, Title: Suicidal Thoughts and Self-injurious Behavior Associated With Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor Agonists - A Review., Abstract: GLP-1 receptor agonists mimic the actions of GLP-1 and are used to manage type 2 diabetes and help with weight loss. In recent times, antidiabetic GLP-1 receptor agonists have been misused widely for weight loss. This review article focuses on some serious side effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists, notified by different regulatory agencies. We searched the literature in online databases such as Medline/Pubmed/PMC, Google Scholar, Science Direct, Ebsco, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, and reference lists to identify publications relevant to the serious side effects associated with the use of GLP-1 receptor agonists. Various pharmacovigilance analyses and notifications from different regulatory agencies have documented the occurrence of suicidal thoughts and self-injurious behavior associated with the use of GLP-1 receptor agonists. Healthcare professionals should be aware of GLP-1 receptor agonistsassociated suicidal thoughts and self-injurious behavior. Patients should not misuse/abuse antidiabetic GLP-1 receptor agonists and should consult their physician before using any GLP-1 receptor agonists for weight loss.\n",
            "ID: 38766817, Title: A Comprehensive Review on the Significance of Cysteine in Various Metabolic Disorders; Particularly CVD, Diabetes, Renal Dysfunction, and Ischemic Stroke., Abstract: Metabolic disorders have long been a challenge for medical professionals and are a leading cause of mortality in adults. Diabetes, cardiovascular disorders (CVD), renal dysfunction, and ischemic stroke are the most prevalent ailments contributing to a high mortality rate worldwide. Reactive oxygen species are one of the leading factors that act as a fundamental root cause of metabolic syndrome. All of these disorders have their respective treatments, which, to some degree, sabotage the pathological worsening of the disease and an inevitable death. However, they pose a perilous health hazard to humankind. Cysteine, a functional amino acid shows promise for the prevention and treatment of metabolic disorders, such as CVD, Diabetes mellitus, renal dysfunction, and ischemic stroke. In this review, we explored whether cysteine can eradicate reactive oxygen species and subsequently prevent and treat these diseases.\n",
            "ID: 38766710, Title: Beyond CAR T cells: exploring alternative cell sources for CAR-like cellular therapies., Abstract: Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy has led to remarkable clinical outcomes in the treatment of hematological malignancies. However, challenges remain, such as limited infiltration into solid tumors, inadequate persistence, systemic toxicities, and manufacturing insufficiencies. The use of alternative cell sources for CAR-based therapies, such as natural killer cells (NK), macrophages (MΦ), invariant Natural Killer T (iNKT) cells, γδT cells, neutrophils, and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC), has emerged as a promising avenue. By harnessing these cells' inherent cytotoxic mechanisms and incorporating CAR technology, common CAR-T cell-related limitations can be effectively mitigated. We herein present an overview of the tumoricidal mechanisms, CAR designs, and manufacturing processes of CAR-NK cells, CAR-MΦ, CAR-iNKT cells, CAR-γδT cells, CAR-neutrophils, and iPSC-derived CAR-cells, outlining the advantages, limitations, and potential solutions of these therapeutic strategies.\n",
            "ID: 38766684, Title: Rural and remote pharmacists' perspectives of grey nomads with diabetes travelling in Australia., Abstract: The objective of the research was to explore rural and remote pharmacists' experiences of encountering grey nomads with diabetes. A qualitative Interpretive Description design was used to explore and capture the experiences of rural and remote pharmacists interacting with grey nomads who had diabetes. Data from the interviews were analysed thematically. The Pharmacy Guild of Australia was approached and through their membership rural and remote pharmacists were invited to participate in the research. Nine rural and remote pharmacists who had encounters and provided services to grey nomads with diabetes responded to be interviewed. The analysed findings established four major themes including: the influence of rural and remote locations on services; common problems encountered by the pharmacists; preparation for travel by grey nomads with diabetes; and pharmacists' preparedness to support grey nomads with diabetes. The findings of this study identified that pharmacists needed remuneration for services provided to grey nomads with diabetes. Also, further development of the My Health record and telehealth to include pharmacists would be advantageous for grey nomads who have diabetes. Pharmacists stated there was a need for further education and a continuing professional development module specifically designed for pharmacists on diabetes self-management that moved beyond medications. A pre-travel checklist for grey nomads with diabetes travelling in rural and remote Australia would benefit all stakeholders through better preparation of travellers with diabetes to self-manage, thereby reducing the demand for health services including pharmacies.\n",

            "ID: 38766602, Title: Living with diabetes in Northeast India: An exploration of psychosocial factors in management., Abstract: India is the 'Diabetes Capital of the World' and accounts for one in seven adults living with diabetes worldwide. Psychosocial, economic, and cultural correlates of disease have important implications for disease management but are rarely explored in India. The purpose of this study is to address psychosocial and cultural factors in diabetes management in the northeastern region of India which has a high disease burden. This study attempts to explore the psychosocial and lived experience of diabetes in the northeastern state of Meghalaya. The sample was selected from individuals attending an outpatient facility of a multi-speciality clinic. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 25 individuals (13 women and 12 men), above the age of 40 years, who had been diagnosed with diabetes for at least 6 months. The narratives were analysed using thematic analysis. Using the social cognitive framework, themes were organized in terms of a thematic map linking knowledge of diabetes to the perception of diabetes as 'a silent killer', to coping, leading to self-efficacy. However high self-efficacy, over time, may lead to complacency, disrupting health behaviours and requiring re-establishment of those behaviours. Adequate knowledge along with cognitive adaptation and self-efficacy were important constructs that contributed to behaviour change and maintenance. Elements of the cultural context were observed in the spiritual aspects of adaptation, the socially isolating consequences of diabetes, as well as gender differences in social support and management. Understanding the lived experiences of patients contributes to planning more effective interventions keeping the social and cultural context in mind for more effective management of diabetes. Additionally, acknowledging and supporting women's needs in diabetes management is called for.\n",
            "ID: 38766597, Title: Association of High apoB/apoA1 Ratio with Increased Erythrocytes, Platelet/Lymphocyte Ratio, D-dimer, Uric Acid and Cardiac Remodeling in Elderly Heart Failure Patients: A Retrospective Study., Abstract: Previous studies have confirmed that high apolipoprotein B/apolipoprotein A1 (apoB/apoA1) ratio was associated with increased mortality from heart failure (HF). Furthermore, the association of plasma apoB/apoA1 ratio with clinical characteristics and adverse cardiac remodeling is still limited in chronic HF with mildly reduced ejection fraction (HFmrEF) elderly patients. Therefore, this study investigated the association of apoB/apoA1 ratio with clinical characteristics and adverse cardiac remodeling in chronic HFmrEF elderly patients. A total of 587 Chinese elderly (≥65 years) with coronary heart disease (CHD), HFmrEF (EF 40-50%) and related blood biochemical data were collected retrospectively. The cross-sectional data of echocardiographic and blood parameters were compared between binary apoB/apoA1 groups. In the elderly CHD patients with chronic HFmrEF, the univariate correlation analysis showed that apoB/apoA1 was correlated with younger age, increased prevalence of type 2 diabetes, erythrocytes, platelet/lymphocyte ratio (PLR), D-dimer, fibrinogen, high sensitivity C-reactive protein and uric acid, and adverse cardiac remodeling (All <i>P</i> < 0.05). However, multivariate logistic binary regression analysis found that high apoB/apoA1 ratio (≥0.62) was independently correlated with younger age, increased erythrocytes, PLR, D-dimer and uric acid, and adverse cardiac remodeling (All <i>P</i> < 0.05). In this retrospective study, the high apoB/apoA1 ratio is found to be associated with younger age, increased erythrocytes, PLR, D-dimer and uric acid, and adverse cardiac remodeling in Chinese CHD elderly with chronic HFmrEF.\n",
            "ID: 38766579, Title: The effect of Tecar therapy on neurological disorders and nerve conduction velocity of lower limbs in peripheral neuropathy of type 2 diabetic patients: A six-week follow-up study., Abstract: This study aimed to investigate the effect of Tecar therapy on neuropathy symptoms and tibial nerve conduction velocity in individuals with diabetes. The single-blind, randomized, sham-controlled clinical trial was conducted between January 2019 and October 2019. Twenty-four type 2 diabetics (8 males, 16 females; mean age: 60.4±8.9 years; range, 40 to 78 years) with peripheral neuropathy were randomly allocated to control (n=12) and study (n=12) groups. The study group received the capacitive Tecar therapy with 10 to 30% intensity and infrared radiation in 10 sessions. The controls received the same protocol with zero intensity. The neuropathy symptoms and nerve conduction velocity were evaluated at baseline, after 10 sessions, and six weeks after the end of sessions. There were no significant differences in variables (p>0.05). In this way, the homogeneity of the data variables was confirmed. Moreover, the results of two-way mixed analysis of variance showed that improvement of neuropathy symptoms in the study group was significantly more than controls in all stages (p<0.001). After 10 sessions, the results of post hoc analysis showed that the neuropathy symptoms and tibial nerve conduction velocity were significantly improved in both groups (p<0.05). However, there was no change in these outcomes after six weeks in the control group (p>0.05). Tecar therapy could improve neuropathy symptoms and tibial nerve conduction velocity in diabetic individuals with peripheral neuropathy. Therefore, the use of this method to control the symptoms of diabetic patients can be recommended.\n",

However, the material basis and action mechanisms of YGYSG against HN remain unclear. Consequently, this study utilized a comprehensive method integrating ultraperformance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF/MS), network pharmacology, and molecular docking to delineate the active ingredients and potential therapeutic mechanisms of YGYSG for treating HN. Firstly, sixty distinct components were recognized in total as potential active ingredients in YGYSG by UPLC-Q-TOF/MS. Subsequently, the mechanisms of YGYSG against HN were revealed for the first time using network pharmacology. 23 ingredients played key roles in the complete network and were the key active ingredients, which could affect the renin-angiotensin system, fluid shear stress and atherosclerosis, HIF-1 signaling pathway, and AGE-RAGE signaling pathway in diabetic complications by regulating 29 key targets such as TNF, IL6, ALB, EGFR, ACE, and MMP2. YGYSG could treat HN through the suppression of inflammatory response and oxidative stress, attenuating the proliferation of renal vascular smooth muscle cells, lessening glomerular capillary systolic pressure, and ameliorating renal dysfunction and vascular damage through the aforementioned targets and pathways. Molecular docking results revealed that most key active ingredients exhibited a high affinity for binding to the key targets. This study pioneers in clarifying the bioactive compounds and molecular mechanisms of YGYSG against HN and offers scientific reference into the clinical application.\n",
            "ID: 38766514, Title: Communication rules regarding support seeking in patients with a physical illness, according to people with a Surinamese or a Dutch cultural background., Abstract: People with different cultural backgrounds can evaluate the appropriateness of direct and indirect support seeking differently. In this study we explored how direct and indirect communication rules for verbal support seeking by patients with diabetes were perceived among Dutch and Surinamese female participants, and whether the appropriateness differed for the ingroup, outgroup and intercultural support seeker-support provider interactions. The study applied a 2 (direct versus indirect support seeking) X 2 (Surinamese patient versus Dutch patient) X 2 (Surinamese support provider versus Dutch support provider)-design. Dutch and Surinamese participants (<i>N</i> = 686) were randomly assigned to one of the eight conditions in which they were provided with a depiction of the patient, the direct or indirect request for help, and the help provider. The main outcome was the rated appropriateness of the help-seeking request in the specific context. The results revealed a significant main effect of communication style: both, Surinamese and Dutch participants evaluated the direct help-seeking as more appropriate compared to indirect help-seeking, independent of patient or provider culture. This effect was particularly strong in participants who scored high on the individual difference in independent self, as shown by a significant interaction. Literature usually identifies that Surinamese and Dutch populations have different cultural backgrounds and values that express themselves in different attitudes, in general more collectivistic and more individualistic, respectively. However, with regard to help seeking preferences the study results did not verify this expectation. These findings underscore the importance of the support providers' role in assessing and understanding the individuals' communication style with regard to help-seeking, rather than assuming communication preferences on the basis of cultural background.\n",
            "ID: 38766504, Title: A comprehensive investigation on alleviating oxidative stress and inflammation in hyperglycaemic conditions through <i>in vitro</i> experiments and computational analysis., Abstract: Protein glycation, hyper-inflammatory reactions, and oxidative stress play a crucial role in the pathophysiology of numerous diseases. The current work evaluated the protective ability of ethyl alcohol extract of leaves from holy basil (<i>Ocimum sanctum</i> Linn) against inflammation, oxidative stress, glycation and advanced glycation endproducts formation. Various <i>in vitro</i> assays assessed prementioned properties of holy basil. In addition, molecular docking was conducted. The highest hydrogen peroxide reduction activity (72.7 %) and maximum percentage of DPPH scavenging (71.3 %) depicted its vigorous antioxidant abilities. Furthermore, it showed the most excellent protection against proteinase activity (67.247 %), prevention of denaturation of egg albumin (65.29 %), and BSA (bovine serum albumin) (68.87 %) with 600 µg/ml. Percent aggregation index (57.528 %), browning intensity (56.61 %), and amyloid structure (57.0 %) were all reduced significantly using 600 μg/ml of extract. Additionally, the antimicrobial potential was also confirmed. According to a molecular docking study, active leaf extract ingredients were found to bind with superoxide dismutase, catalase, and carbonic anhydrase. As a conclusion, <i>O. sanctum</i> has a variety of health-promoting properties that may reduce the severity of many diseases in diabetic patients. However, in order to ascertain the mechanisms of action of the components of its leaves in disease prevention, more thorough research based on pharmacological aspects is needed.\n",
            "ID: 38766481, Title: Balance performance, falls-efficacy and social participation in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with and without vestibular dysfunction., Abstract: The performance of balance is an important factor to perform activities. The complications of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), especially vestibular dysfunction (VD), could decrease balance performance and falls-efficacy (FE) which consequently impacts social participation and quality of life (QoL). This study aimed to compare balance performance, FE, social participation and QoL between individuals with T2DM with and without VD. The participants comprised 161 T2DM with VD and 161 without VD. Three clinical tests used for confirming VD included the Head Impulse Test (HIT), the Dix Hallpike Test (DHT) and the Supine Roll Test (SRT). The scores of static and dynamic balances, FE, social participation and QoL were compared between groups. The balance performance, FE, social participation and QoL were lower in the group with VD. The number of patients who had severe social restriction was higher in T2DM with VD than without VD (58.4% <i>vs</i> 48.4%). Moreover, all domains of QoL (physical, psychological, social relationships and environmental) were lower in T2DM with VD than without VD. The presence of VD in T2DM patients was associated with decreased physical balance performances and increased social and QoL disengagement. Comprehensive management related to balance and FE, as well as the monitoring to support social participation and QoL, should be emphasized in patients with T2DM with VD.\n",

Over the past century, insulin formulations have undergone significant modifications and bioengineering, resulting in a diverse range of available insulin products. These products show distinct pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles. Consequently, various insulin regimens have em-erged for the management of type 2 diabetes, including premixed formulations and combinations of basal and bolus insulins. The utilization of different insulin regimens yields disparate clinical outcomes, adverse events, and, notably, patient-reported outcomes (PROs). PROs provide valuable insights from the patient's perspective, serving as a valuable mine of information for enhancing healthcare and informing clinical decisions. Adherence to insulin therapy, a critical patient-reported outcome, significantly affects clinical outcomes and is influenced by multiple factors. This review provides insights into the clinical effectiveness of various insulin preparations, PROs, and factors impacting insulin therapy adherence, with the aim of enhancing healthcare practices and informing clinical decisions for individuals with type 2 diabetes.\n",
            "ID: 38766442, Title: Associations of serum D-dimer and glycosylated hemoglobin levels with third-trimester fetal growth restriction in gestational diabetes mellitus., Abstract: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a special type of diabetes that commonly occurs in women during pregnancy and involves impaired glucose tolerance and abnormal glucose metabolism; GDM is diagnosed for the first time during pregnancy and can affect fetal growth and development. To investigate the associations of serum D-dimer (D-D) and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels with third-trimester fetal growth restriction (FGR) in GDM patients. The clinical data of 164 pregnant women who were diagnosed with GDM and delivered at the Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital of Fudan University from January 2021 to January 2023 were analyzed retrospectively. Among these women, 63 whose fetuses had FGR were included in the FGR group, and 101 women whose fetuses had normal body weights were included in the normal body weight group (normal group). Fasting venous blood samples were collected from the elbow at 28-30 wk gestation and 1-3 d before delivery to measure serum D-D and HbA1c levels for comparative analysis. The diagnostic value of serum D-D and HbA1c levels for FGR was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic analysis, and the influencing factors of third-trimester FGR in GDM patients were analyzed by logistic regression. Serum fasting blood glucose, fasting insulin, D-D and HbA1c levels were significantly greater in the FGR group than in the normal group, while the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance values were lower (<i>P</i> < 0.05). Regarding the diagnosis of FGR based on serum D-D and HbA1c levels, the areas under the curves (AUCs) were 0.826 and 0.848, the cutoff values were 3.04 mg/L and 5.80%, the sensitivities were 81.0% and 79.4%, and the specificities were 88.1% and 87.1%, respectively. The AUC of serum D-D plus HbA1c levels for diagnosing FGR was 0.928, and the sensitivity and specificity were 84.1% and 91.1%, respectively. High D-D and HbA1c levels were risk factors for third-trimester FGR in GDM patients (<i>P</i> < 0.05). D-D and HbA1c levels can indicate the occurrence of FGR in GDM patients in the third trimester of pregnancy to some extent, and their combination can be used as an important index for the early prediction of FGR.\n",
            "ID: 38766441, Title: Efficacy of Huangma Ding or autologous platelet-rich gel for the diabetic lower extremity arterial disease patients with foot ulcers., Abstract: Diabetes foot is one of the most serious complications of diabetes and an important cause of death and disability, traditional treatment has poor efficacy and there is an urgent need to develop a practical treatment method. To investigate whether Huangma Ding or autologous platelet-rich gel (APG) treatment would benefit diabetic lower extremity arterial disease (LEAD) patients with foot ulcers. A total of 155 diabetic LEAD patients with foot ulcers were enrolled and divided into three groups: Group A (62 patients; basal treatment), Group B (38 patients; basal treatment and APG), and Group C (55 patients; basal treatment and Huangma Ding). All patients underwent routine follow-up visits for six months. After follow-up, we calculated the changes in all variables from baseline and determined the differences between groups and the relationships between parameters. The infection status of the three groups before treatment was the same. Procalcitonin (PCT) improved after APG and Huangma Ding treatment more than after traditional treatment and was significantly greater in Group C than in Group B. Logistic regression analysis revealed that PCT was positively correlated with total amputation, primary amputation, and minor amputation rates. The ankle-brachial pressure and the transcutaneous oxygen pressure in Groups B and C were greater than those in Group A. The major amputation rate, minor amputation rate, and total amputation times in Groups B and C were lower than those in Group A. Our research indicated that diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) lead to major amputation, minor amputation, and total amputation through local infection and poor microcirculation and macrocirculation. Huangma Ding and APG were effective attreating DFUs. The clinical efficacy of Huangma Ding was better than that of autologous platelet gel, which may be related to the better control of local infection by Huangma Ding. This finding suggested that in patients with DFUs combined with coinfection, controlling infection is as important as improving circulation.\n",
            "ID: 38766440, Title: Impact of tibial transverse transport in tissue regeneration and wound healing with perspective on diabetic foot ulcers., Abstract: In this editorial, we comment on an article by Liao <i>et al</i> published in the current issue of the <i>World Journal of Diabetes</i>. We focus on the clinical significance of tibial transverse transport (TTT) as an effective treatment for patients with diabetic foot ulcers (DFU). TTT has been associated with tissue regeneration, improved blood circulation, reduced amputation rates, and increased expression of early angiogenic factors. Mechanistically, TTT can influence macrophage polarization and growth factor upregulation. Despite this potential, the limitations and conflicting results of existing studies justify the need for further research into its optimal application and development. These clinical implications highlight the efficacy of TTT in recalcitrant DFU and provide lasting stimuli for tissue re-generation, and blood vessel and bone marrow improvement. Immunomodulation <i>via</i> systemic responses contributes to its therapeutic potential. Future studies should investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms to enhance our understanding and the efficacy of TTT. This manuscript emphasizes the potential of TTT in limb preservation and diabetic wound healing and suggests avenues for preventive measures against limb amputation in diabetes and peripheral artery disease. Here, we highlight the clinical significance of the TTT and its importance in healing DFU to promote the use of this technique in tissue regeneration.\n",
            "ID: 38766439, Title: Synaptotagmins family affect glucose transport in retinal pigment epithelial cells through their ubiquitination-mediated degradation and glucose transporter-1 regulation., Abstract: Synaptotagmins (SYTs) are a family of 17 membrane transporters that function as calcium ion sensors during the release of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent neurotransmitters and hormones. However, few studies have reported whether members of the SYT family play a role in glucose uptake in diabetic retinopathy (DR) through Ca<sup>2+</sup>/glucose transporter-1 (GLUT1) and the possible regulatory mechanism of SYTs. To elucidate the role of the SYT family in the regulation of glucose transport in retinal pigment epithelial cells and explore its potential as a therapeutic target for the clinical management of DR. DR was induced by streptozotocin in C57BL/6J mice and by high glucose medium in human retinal pigment epithelial cells (ARPE-19). Bioinformatics analysis, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, Western blot, flow cytometry, ELISA, HE staining, and TUNEL staining were used for analysis. Six differentially expressed proteins (SYT2, SYT3, SYT4, SYT7, SYT11, and SYT13) were found between the DR and control groups, and SYT4 was highly expressed. Hyperglycemia induces SYT4 overexpression, manipulates Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx to induce GLUT1 fusion with the plasma membrane, promotes abnormal expression of the glucose transporter GLUT1 and excessive glucose uptake, induces ARPE-19 cell apoptosis, and promotes DR progression. Parkin deficiency inhibits the proteasomal degradation of SYT4 in DR, resulting in SYT4 accumulation and enhanced GLUT1 fusion with the plasma membrane, and these effects were blocked by oe-Parkin treatment. Moreover, dysregulation of the myelin transcription factor 1 (Myt1)-induced transcription of SYT4 in DR further activated the SYT4-mediated stimulus-secretion coupling process, and this process was inhibited in the oe-MYT1-treated group. Our study reveals the key role of SYT4 in regulating glucose transport in retinal pigment epithelial cells during the pathogenesis of DR and the underlying mechanism and suggests potential therapeutic targets for clinical DR.\n",

            "ID: 38766437, Title: Polycytosine RNA-binding protein 1 regulates osteoblast function <i>via</i> a ferroptosis pathway in type 2 diabetic osteoporosis., Abstract: Recently, type 2 diabetic osteoporosis (T2DOP) has become a research hotspot for the complications of diabetes, but the specific mechanism of its occurrence and development remains unknown. Ferroptosis caused by iron overload is con-sidered an important cause of T2DOP. Polycytosine RNA-binding protein 1 (PCBP1), an iron ion chaperone, is considered a protector of ferroptosis. To investigate the existence of ferroptosis and specific role of PCBP1 in the development of type 2 diabetes. A cell counting kit-8 assay was used to detect changes in osteoblast viability under high glucose (HG) and/or ferroptosis inhibitors at different concentrations and times. Transmission electron microscopy was used to examine the morphological changes in the mitochondria of osteoblasts under HG, and western blotting was used to detect the expression levels of PCBP1, ferritin, and the ferroptosis-related protein glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4). A lentivirus silenced and overexpressed PCBP1. Western blotting was used to detect the expression levels of the osteoblast functional proteins osteoprotegerin (OPG) and osteocalcin (OCN), whereas flow cytometry was used to detect changes in reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in each group. Under HG, the viability of osteoblasts was considerably decreased, the number of mitochondria undergoing atrophy was considerably increased, PCBP1 and ferritin expression levels were increased, and GPX4 expression was decreased. Western blotting results demonstrated that infection with lentivirus overexpressing PCBP1, increased the expression levels of ferritin, GPX4, OPG, and OCN, compared with the HG group. Flow cytometry results showed a reduction in ROS, and an opposite result was obtained after silencing PCBP1. PCBP1 may protect osteoblasts and reduce the harm caused by ferroptosis by promoting ferritin expression under a HG environment. Moreover, PCBP1 may be a potential therapeutic target for T2DOP.\n",

Investigating these metabolites could offer valuable insights into the pathophy-siology of NAFLD in T2DM. To identify potential metabolite biomarkers capable of distinguishing between NAFLD and T2DM. A training model was developed involving 399 participants, comprising 113 healthy controls (HCs), 134 individuals with T2DM without NAFLD, and 152 individuals with T2DM and NAFLD. External validation encompassed 172 participants. NAFLD patients were divided based on liver fibrosis scores. The analytical approach employed univariate testing, orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis, logistic regression, receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, and decision curve analysis to pinpoint and assess the diagnostic value of serum biomarkers. Compared to HCs, both T2DM and NAFLD groups exhibited diminished levels of specific BAs. In UFAs, particular acids exhibited a positive correlation with NAFLD risk in T2DM, while the ω-6:ω-3 UFA ratio demonstrated a negative correlation. Levels of α-linolenic acid and γ-linolenic acid were linked to significant liver fibrosis in NAFLD. The validation cohort substantiated the predictive efficacy of these biomarkers for assessing NAFLD risk in T2DM patients. This study underscores the connection between altered BA and UFA profiles and the presence of NAFLD in individuals with T2DM, proposing their potential as biomarkers in the pathogenesis of NAFLD.\n",

While it has been established that 20%-30% of T1D patients suffer from autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD), there is limited available data regarding the presence of anti-islet autoantibodies in AITD patients. Among commercially available anti-islet autoantibodies, glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 autoantibodies (GADAs) are often the first marker measured in general clinical practice. To investigate the frequency of anti-islet autoantibodies in AITD patients. Our study involved four hundred ninety-five AITD patients, categorized into three distinct groups: AITD with T1D (<i>n</i> = 18), AITD with phenotypic type 2 diabetes (T2D) (<i>n</i> = 81), and AITD without diabetes (<i>n</i> = 396), and the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was employed to determine the frequencies of 3 Screen Islet Cell Autoantibody (3 Screen ICA), GADA, insulinoma-associated antigen-2 autoantibodies (IA-2As), and zinc transporter 8 autoantibodies (ZnT8As) within these groups. The frequency of 3 Screen ICA in AITD patients with T1D, T2D, and those without diabetes were 88.9%, 6.2%, and 5.1%, respectively, with no significant difference seen between the latter two groups. Notably, the frequency of 3 Screen ICA was 11.1% higher in AITD patients with T1D, 1.3% higher in AITD patients with T2D, and 1.1% higher in AITD patients without diabetes compared to GADA, respectively. Furthermore, 12.5%, 20.0%, and 20.0% of the 3 Screen ICA-positive patients were negative for GADA. Additionally, 1.3% of the AITD patients who tested negative for 3 Screen ICA in both the AITD with T2D and non-diabetic AITD groups were found to be positive for individual autoantibodies. Among the 3 Screen ICA-positive patients, there was a significantly higher proportion of individuals with multiple autoantibodies in AITD patients with T1D compared to those without diabetes (37.5% <i>vs</i> 5.0%, <i>P</i> < 0.05). However, this proportion was similar to that in AITD patients with T2D (20.0%). Nevertheless, there was no significant difference in 3 Screen ICA titers between AITD patients with T1D and those without diabetes (436.8 ± 66.4 <i>vs</i> 308.1 ± 66.4 index). Additionally, no significant difference in 3 Screen ICA titers was observed between Graves' disease and Hashimoto's thyroiditis in any of the groups. Our findings reveal that some AITD patients without diabetes exhibit 3 Screen ICA titers comparable to those in AITD patients with T1D. Thus, 3 Screen ICA outperforms GADA in identifying latent anti-islet autoantibody-positive individuals among AITD patients.\n",
            "ID: 38766434, Title: Estrogen restores disordered lipid metabolism in visceral fat of prediabetic mice., Abstract: Visceral obesity is increasingly prevalent among adolescents and young adults and is commonly recognized as a risk factor for type 2 diabetes. Estrogen [17β-estradiol (E2)] is known to offer protection against obesity <i>via</i> diverse me-chanisms, while its specific effects on visceral adipose tissue (VAT) remain to be fully elucidated. To investigate the impact of E2 on the gene expression profile within VAT of a mouse model of prediabetes. Metabolic parameters were collected, encompassing body weight, weights of visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissues (VAT and SAT), random blood glucose levels, glucose tolerance, insulin tolerance, and overall body composition. The gene expression profiles of VAT were quantified utilizing the Whole Mouse Genome Oligo Microarray and subsequently analyzed through Agilent Feature Extraction software. Functional and pathway analyses were conducted employing Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analyses, respectively. Feeding a high-fat diet (HFD) moderately increased the weights of both VAT and SAT, but this increase was mitigated by the protective effect of endogenous E2. Conversely, ovariectomy (OVX) led to a significant increase in VAT weight and the VAT/SAT weight ratio, and this increase was also reversed with E2 treatment. Notably, OVX diminished the expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism compared to HFD feeding alone, signaling a widespread reduction in lipid metabolic activity, which was completely counteracted by E2 administration. This study provides a comprehensive insight into E2's local and direct protective effects against visceral adiposity in VAT at the gene level. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that the HFD-induced over-nutritional challenge disrupted the gene expression profile of visceral fat, leading to a universally decreased lipid metabolic status in E2 deficient mice. E2 treatment effectively reversed this condition, shedding light on the mechanistic role and therapeutic potential of E2 in combating visceral obesity.\n",

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic disorder characterized by dysregulated glucose homeostasis. The persistent elevated blood glucose level in T2DM significantly increases the risk of developing severe complications, including cardiovascular disease, re-tinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy. T2DM arises from a complex interplay between genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors. Global genomic studies have identified numerous genetic variations associated with an increased risk of T2DM. Specifically, variations within the glucokinase regulatory protein (GCKR) gene have been linked to heightened susceptibility to T2DM and its associated complications. The clinical trial by Liu <i>et al</i> further elucidates the role of the GCKR rs780094 polymorphism in T2DM and nephropathy development. Their findings demonstrate that individuals carrying the CT or TT genotype at the GCKR rs780094 locus are at a higher risk of developing T2DM with albuminuria compared to those with the CC genotype. These findings highlight the importance of genetic testing and risk assessment in T2DM to develop effective preventive strategies and personalized treatment plans.\n",

To evaluate the risk of infection in patients with T2DM treated with dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors. Electronic databases were searched. The selection criteria included randomized controlled trials focused on cardiovascular outcomes. In these studies, the effects of DPP-4 inhibitors were directly compared to those of either other active anti-diabetic treatments or placebo. Six trials involving 53616 patients were deemed eligible. We calculated aggregate relative risks employing both random-effects and fixed-effects approaches, contingent upon the context. The application of DPP-4 inhibitors showed no significant link to the overall infection risk [0.98 (0.95, 1.02)] or the risk of serious infections [0.96 (0.85, 1.08)], additionally, no significant associations were found with opportunistic infections [0.69 (0.46, 1.04)], site-specific infections [respiratory infection 0.99 (0.96, 1.03), urinary tract infections 1.02 (0.95, 1.10), abdominal and gastrointestinal infections 1.02 (0.83, 1.25), skin structure and soft tissue infections 0.81 (0.60, 1.09), bone infections 0.96 (0.68, 1.36), and bloodstream infections 0.97 (0.80, 1.18)]. This meta-analysis of data from cardiovascular outcome trials revealed no heightened infection risk in patients undergoing DPP-4 inhibitor therapy compared to control cohorts.\n",

Its etiology is closely tied to imbalanced dietary practices and sedentary lifestyles. Conversely, increasing die-tary fiber (DF) intake has consistently demonstrated health benefits in numerous studies, including improvements in glycemic control and weight management. To investigate the efficacy of DF interventions in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). A systematic literature review was conducted to explore the association between DF intake and the management of T2DM. Following the inclusion and exclusion criteria, a total of 26 studies were included in this review. The main strategies implied to increased DF intake were: High DF diet plus acarbose (2 studies); DF supplements (14 studies); and high DF diets (10 studies). Overall, most studies indicated that increased DF intake resulted in im-provements in glycemic control and weight management in T2DM patients. DF represents a valuable strategy in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, improving health outcomes. DF intake offers the potential to improve quality of life and reduce complications and mortality associated with diabetes. Likewise, through supplements or enriched foods, DF contributes significantly to the control of several markers such as HbA1c, blood glucose, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein, and body weight.\n",

However, the mechanism through which <i>Radix Salviae</i> treats DPN remains unclear. Therefore, we aimed to explore the mechanism of action of <i>Radix Salviae</i> against DPN using network pharmacology. The active ingredients and target genes of <i>Radix Salviae</i> were screened using the TCM pharmacology database and analysis platform. The genes associated with DPN were obtained from the Gene Cards and OMIM databases, a drug-com-position-target-disease network was constructed, and a protein-protein inter-action network was subsequently constructed to screen the main targets. Gene Ontology (GO) functional annotation and pathway enrichment analysis were performed <i>via</i> the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) using Bioconductor. A total of 56 effective components, 108 targets and 4581 DPN-related target genes of <i>Radix Salviae</i> were screened. Intervention with <i>Radix Salviae</i> for DPN mainly involved 81 target genes. The top 30 major targets were selected for enrichment analysis of GO and KEGG pathways. These results suggested that <i>Radix Salviae</i> could treat DPN by regulating the AGE-RAGE signaling pathway and the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. Therefore, Danshen may affect DPN by regulating inflammation and apoptosis.\n",

DM [particularly type 2 DM (T2DM)] and TB have converged making their control even more challenging. Two contemporary global epidemics, TB-DM behaves like a syndemic, a synergistic confluence of two highly prevalent diseases. T2DM is a risk factor for developing more severe forms of multi-drug resistant-TB and TB recurrence after preventive treatment. Since a bidirectional relationship exists between TB and DM, it is necessary to concurrently treat both, and promote recommendations for the joint management of both diseases. There are also some drug-drug interactions resulting in adverse treatment outcomes in TB-DM patients including treatment failure, and reinfection. In addition, autophagy may play a role in these comorbidities. Therefore, the TB-DM comorbidities present several health challenges, requiring a focus on multidisciplinary collaboration and integrated strategies, to effectively deal with this double burden. To effectively manage the comorbidity, further screening in affected countries, more suitable drugs, and better treatment strategies are required.\n",
            "ID: 38766426, Title: Rising tide: The global surge of type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents demands action now., Abstract: Childhood-onset obesity has emerged as a major public healthcare challenge across the globe, fueled by an obesogenic environment and influenced by both genetic and epigenetic predispositions. This has led to an exponential rise in the incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus in children and adolescents. The looming wave of diabetes-related complications in early adulthood is anticipated to strain the healthcare budgets in most countries. Unless there is a collective global effort to curb the devastation caused by the situation, the impact is poised to be pro-found. A multifaceted research effort, governmental legislation, and effective social action are crucial in attaining this goal. This article delves into the current epidemiological landscape, explores evidence concerning potential risks and consequences, delves into the pathobiology of childhood obesity, and discusses the latest evidence-based management strategies for diabesity.\n",
            "ID: 38766425, Title: Cardioprotective effects of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists in heart failure: Myth or truth?, Abstract: Therapy with glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP1) receptor agonists has raised great interest for its beneficial cardiovascular effects in preventing atherosclerosis and heart failure-related outcomes. However, while evidence about atherosclerosis consistently suggests a cardioprotective potential with class effect, controversies remain on its impact on heart failure. GLP1 receptor agonists appear to prevent hospitalization for new-onset heart failure and reduce symptoms in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (as demonstrated by the recent STEP-HFpEF Trial). Still, GLP1 agonism has resulted in neutral or even harmful effects in patients with established heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (the LIVE trial). GLP1 receptor agonists benefit the cardiovascular system indirectly through their marked metabolic effects (improved weight management, glycemic control, blood pressure, systemic and tissue inflammation), while direct effects on the heart have been questioned. Nonetheless, weight loss alone achieved through GLP1 receptor agonists has failed in improving left ventricular functions. Tirzepatide is a dual agonist of GLP1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide, representing an innovative treatment option in diabetes with a major impact on weight loss and promising cardiovascular benefits. Whether this class of therapies is going to change the history of heart failure is an ongoing debate.\n",
            "ID: 38766424, Title: Global status and trends of metabolomics in diabetes: A literature visualization knowledge graph study., Abstract: Diabetes is a metabolic disease characterized by hyperglycemia, which has increased the global medical burden and is also the main cause of death in most countries. To understand the knowledge structure of global development status, research focus, and future trend of the relationship between diabetes and metabolomics in the past 20 years. The articles about the relationship between diabetes and metabolomics in the Web of Science Core Collection were retrieved from 2002 to October 23, 2023, and the relevant information was analyzed using CiteSpace6.2.2R (CiteSpace), VOSviewer6.1.18 (VOSviewer), and Bibliometrix software under R language.

            "ID: 38766423, Title: Challenges and pitfalls of youth-onset type 2 diabetes., Abstract: The incidence and prevalence of youth-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are increasing. The rise in frequency and severity of childhood obesity, inclination to sedentary lifestyle, and epigenetic risks related to prenatal hyperglycemia exposure are important drivers of the youth-onset T2DM epidemic and might as well be responsible for the early onset of diabetes complications. Indeed, youth-onset T2DM has a more extreme metabolic phenotype than adult-onset T2DM, with greater insulin resistance and more rapid deterioration of beta cell function. Therefore, intermediate complications such as microalbuminuria develop in late childhood or early adulthood, while end-stage complications develop in mid-life. Due to the lack of efficacy and safety data, several drugs available for the treatment of adults with T2DM have not been approved in youth, reducing the pharmacological treatment options. In this mini review, we will try to address the present challenges and pitfalls related to youth-onset T2DM and summarize the available interventions to mitigate the risk of microvascular and macrovascular complications.\n",
            "ID: 38766422, Title: Drawing lines in the sand: The growing threat of obesity in type 1 diabetes., Abstract: In this editorial, we comment on the article by Zeng <i>et al</i> published in the recent issue of the <i>World Journal of Diabetes</i> in 2024. We focus on the epidemiological, pathophysiological, and clinical interplay between obesity and type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Overweight and obesity represent a growing threat for modern societies and people with T1DM could not be an exception to this rule. Chronic exogenous insulin administration, genetic and epigenetic factors, and psy-chosocial and behavioral parameters, along with the modern way of life that incorporates unhealthy eating patterns and physical inactivity, set the stage for the increasing obesity rates in T1DM. As our knowledge of the underlying mechanisms that lead to the development of obesity and hyperglycemia expands, it becomes clear that there are overlap zones in the pathophysiology of the two main types of diabetes. Stereotypes regarding strict dividing lines between \"autoimmune\" and \"metabolic\" phenotypes increase the risk of trapping physicians into ineffective therapeutic approaches, instead of individualized diabetes care. In this context, the use of adjuncts to insulin therapy that have the potential to alleviate cardiorenal risk and decrease body weight can reduce the burden of obesity in patients with T1DM.\n",
            "ID: 38766421, Title: Disparate outcomes in Hispanic patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease/steatohepatitis and type 2 diabetes: Large cohort study., Abstract: Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) are a growing health burden across a significant portion of the global patient population. However, these conditions seem to have disparate rates and outcomes between different ethnic populations. The combination of MASLD/MASH and type 2 diabetes increases the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and Hispanic patients experience the greatest burden, particularly those in South Texas. To compare outcomes between Hispanic and non-Hispanic patients in the United States, while further focusing on the Hispanic population within Southeast Texas to determine whether the documented disparity in outcomes is a function of geographical circumstance or if there is a more widespread reason that all clinicians must account for in prognostic consideration. This cohort analysis was conducted with data obtained from TriNetX, LLC (\"TriNetX\"), a global federated health research network that provides access to deidentified medical records from healthcare organizations worldwide. Two cohort networks were used: University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) hospital and the United States national database collective to determine whether disparities were related to geographic regions, like Southeast Texas. This study findings revealed Hispanics/Latinos have a statistically significant higher occurrence of HCC, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and liver fibrosis/cirrhosis in both the United States and the UTMB Hispanic/Latino groups. All-cause mortality in Hispanics/Latinos was lower within the United States group and not statistically elevated in the UTMB cohort. This would appear to support that Hispanic patients in Southeast Texas are not uniquely affected compared to the national Hispanic population.\n",

This cross-sectional observational study was conducted at a Bahrain government health centre. Thirty-three Bahraini Arab adults, 30-60 years old, with controlled type 2 diabetes, wore a Fitbit Flex 2<sup>TM</sup> activity tracker for 10 weeks. Data on age, sex, marital and employment status, education and BMI were collected at the start of the study. A total of <i>N</i> = 32 participants completed the study. The average steps per day were 7859 ± 4131, and there were no differences between baseline, week 5 and 10. A third of participants were sedentary, based on a threshold of 5000 steps/day. Females accumulated fewer average daily steps than males (6728 ± 2936 vs. 10,281 ± 4623, <i>p</i> = 0.018). Daily averages for physical activity intensity were as follows: sedentary (786 ± 109 min), light (250 ± 76 min), moderate (9 ± 10 min) and vigorous (12 ± 18 min). Males had higher daily averages versus females for moderate (13 ± 9 vs. 5 ± 9 min, <i>p</i> = 0.018) and vigorous physical activity (21 ± 23 vs. 5 ± 7 min, <i>p</i> = 0.034). 91% of participants wore the device ≥10 h/day. The adherence rate was 79% based on percentage of days the device was worn continuously over 10 weeks. Future physical activity interventions should target sedentary and female participants with type 2 diabetes. In addition, we need to understand the facilitators and barriers to physical activity and the physical activity preferences of these two subgroups.\n",

Forty-three eyes of 43 patients followed up with orbital mucormycosis infections were included in the study. Demographic characteristics of the patients, symptoms at admission, ophthalmologic and non-ophthalmologic examination findings, clinical findings during follow-up, medical and surgical procedures, and complications were recorded. Patient survival was determined by assessing the incidence of mortality, and vision survival was defined as achieving a final visual acuity of at least light perception. Twenty-seven (62.8%) patients were male, and 16 (37.2%) were female. When the underlying disease status of the patients was examined, it was observed that all patients had an underlying disease and diabetes constituted the majority (65.2%). Periorbital swelling (69.8%) and ophthalmoplegia (53.5%) were the most common symptoms and findings at the admission of patients with mucormycosis infection. The disease resulted in death in 22 (51.2%) patients. The presence of fever and shorter duration of antifungal therapy were associated with lower patient survival. Exenteration surgery was not found to be associated with the survival of the patients. Frozen eye, loss of pupillary light reflex, and development of central retinal artery occlusion were associated with lower vision survival. This study presents one of the most extensive patient series in the literature on rhino-orbital mucormycosis. Knowing the patients' symptoms at the time of admission and the clinical findings during the infection process will increase awareness about the disease.\n",
            "ID: 38766348, Title: Identifying the stability of housekeeping genes to be used for the quantitative real-time PCR normalization in retinal tissue of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats., Abstract: To investigate the stability of the seven housekeeping genes: beta-actin (<i>ActB</i>), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (<i>GAPDH</i>), 18s ribosomal unit 5 (<i>18s</i>), cyclophilin A (<i>CycA</i>), hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (<i>HPRT</i>), ribosomal protein large P0 (<i>36B4</i>) and terminal uridylyl transferase 1 (<i>U6</i>) in the diabetic retinal tissue of rat model. The expression of these seven genes in rat retinal tissues was determined using real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) in two groups; normal control rats and streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. The stability analysis of gene expression was investigated using geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and comparative delta-Ct (ΔCt) algorithms. The <i>36B4</i> gene was stably expressed in the retinal tissues of normal control animals; however, it was less stable in diabetic retinas. The <i>18s</i> gene was expressed consistently in both normal control and diabetic rats' retinal tissue. That this gene was the best reference for data normalisation in RT-qPCR studies that used the retinal tissue of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. Furthermore, there was no ideal gene stably expressed for use in all experimental settings. Identifying relevant genes is a need for achieving RT-qPCR validity and reliability and must be appropriately achieved based on a specific experimental setting.\n",
            "ID: 38766339, Title: Gut microbiota induced abnormal amino acids and their correlation with diabetic retinopathy., Abstract: To explore the correlation of gut microbiota and the metabolites with the progression of diabetic retinopathy (DR) and provide a novel strategy to elucidate the pathological mechanism of DR. The fecal samples from 32 type 2 diabetes patients with proliferative retinopathy (PDR), 23 with non-proliferative retinopathy (NPDR), 27 without retinopathy (DM), and 29 from the sex-, age- and BMI- matched healthy controls (29 HC) were analyzed by 16S rDNA gene sequencing. Sixty fecal samples from PDR, DM, and HC groups were assayed by untargeted metabolomics. Fecal metabolites were measured using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis. Associations between gut microbiota and fecal metabolites were analyzed. A cluster of 2 microbiome and 12 metabolites accompanied with the severity of DR, and the close correlation of the disease progression with PDR-related microbiome and metabolites were found. To be specific, the structure of gut microbiota differed in four groups. Diversity and richness of gut microbiota were significantly lower in PDR and NPDR groups, than those in DM and HC groups. A cluster of microbiome enriched in PDR group, including <i>Pseudomonas</i>, <i>Ruminococcaceae-UCG-002</i>, <i>Ruminococcaceae-UCG-005</i>, <i>Christensenellaceae-R-7</i>, was observed. Functional analysis showed that the glucose and nicotinate degradations were significantly higher in PDR group than those in HC group. Arginine, serine, ornithine, and arachidonic acid were significantly enriched in PDR group, while proline was enriched in HC group. Functional analysis illustrated that arginine biosynthesis, lysine degradation, histidine catabolism, central carbon catabolism in cancer, D-arginine and D-ornithine catabolism were elevated in PDR group. Correlation analysis revealed that <i>Ruminococcaceae-UCG-002</i> and <i>Christensenellaceae-R-7</i> were positively associated with L-arginine, ornithine levels in fecal samples. This study elaborates the different microbiota structure in the gut from four groups. The relative abundance of <i>Ruminococcaceae-UCG-002</i> and <i>Parabacteroides</i> are associated with the severity of DR. Amino acid and fatty acid catabolism is especially disordered in PDR group. This may help provide a novel diagnostic parameter for DR, especially PDR.\n",

This retrospective study included 141 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM): 45 without diabetic retinopathy (NDR), 47 with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR), and 49 with proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). Complete blood counts were obtained, and NLR, PLR, and SII were calculated. The study analysed the ability of inflammatory markers to predict DR using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The relationships between DR stages and SII, PLR, and NLP were assessed using multivariate logistic regression. The average NLR, PLR, and SII were higher in the PDR group than in the NPDR group (<i>P</i>=0.011, 0.043, 0.009, respectively); higher in the NPDR group than in the NDR group (<i>P</i><0.001 for all); and higher in the PDR group than in the NDR group (<i>P</i><0.001 for all). In the ROC curve analysis, the NLR, PLR, and SII were significant predictors of DR (<i>P</i><0.001 for all). The highest area under the curve (AUC) was for the PLR (0.929 for PLR, 0.925 for SII, and 0.821 for NLR). Multivariate regression analysis indicated that NLR, PLR, and SII were statistically significantly positive and independent predictors for the DR stages in patients with DM [odds ratio (OR)=1.122, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.200-2.043, <i>P</i><0.05; OR=0.038, 95%CI: 0.018-0.058, <i>P</i><0.05; OR=0.007, 95%CI: 0.001-0.01, <i>P</i><0.05, respectively).

            "ID: 38766320, Title: Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter-2 Inhibitors and Cardiovascular Protection Among Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: A Systematic Review., Abstract: <b>Background:</b> Accumulating evidence has demonstrated the positive effects of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors in managing patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). SGLT2 inhibitors protect patients with T2DM from cardiovascular complications and are generally safe. <b>Aim:</b> The aim of this study is to assess the cardiovascular effects of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with T2DM. <b>Methods:</b> A systematic review was conducted using published English literature in PubMed and Google Scholar databases. <b>Results:</b> Most of the studies showed significant positive cardiovascular effects of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with and without established cardiovascular disease (CVD). Empagliflozin reduced the risk of cardiovascular death, hospitalization for heart failure (HHF), cardiovascular death or heart failure, and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) such as nonfatal stroke, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular death regardless of the number of cardiovascular risk factors. The effects of empagliflozin on cardiovascular events and mortality in patients with coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) were assessed. Further, the efficacy of empagliflozin in three different phenotypic groups, namely, younger patients with shorter duration of T2DM and highest glomerular filtration rate, women without coronary artery disease, and older adults with advanced coronary artery disease plus several comorbidities, was also assessed. The effects of canagliflozin were evaluated in patients with and without a history of CVD and with different body weights, and in those with and without prior heart failure. Treatment with canagliflozin based on multivariable-predicted cardiovascular risk factors prevented heart failure events more than treatment based on glycated hemoglobin and albuminuria alone. The efficacy of dapagliflozin was evaluated in patients with or at risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), heart failure status, and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), as well as the elderly population. A reduction in HHF or cardiovascular death and insignificant reduction in MACE were noted. Furthermore, significant reduction in the risk of cardiovascular death and all-cause mortality in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) was also observed. Sotagliflozin was studied for its cardiovascular outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease with or without albuminuria and resulted in a reduction in cardiovascular-related deaths and HHF. <b>Conclusion:</b> SGLT2 inhibitors have beneficial cardiovascular effects in patients with T2DM and should be incorporated into their management.\n",

Functional and pathway enrichment analyses were conducted to elucidate the involved biological processes (BP) and pathways. Weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) identified modules associated with DKD. LASSO regression and random forest selected NET-related characteristic genes (NRGs) related to DKD tubulointerstitial injury. <b>Results:</b> Eight hundred ninety-eight DEGs were identified from the GSE30122 dataset. A significant module associated with diabetic tubulointerstitial injury overlapped with 15 NRGs. The hub genes, CASP1 and LYZ, were identified as potential biomarkers. Functional enrichment linked these genes with immune cell trafficking, metabolic alterations, and inflammatory responses. NRGs negatively correlated with glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in the Neph v5 database. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) validated increased NRGs in DKD tubulointerstitial injury. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our findings suggest that the CASP1 and LYZ genes may serve as potential diagnostic biomarkers for diabetic tubulointerstitial injury. Furthermore, NRGs involved in diabetic tubulointerstitial injury could emerge as prospective targets for the diagnosis and treatment of DKD.\n",

It has several physiological functions such as blood colloidal osmotic pressure, antioxidant activity, binding and transporting of endogenous and exogenous substrates. We conducted an electronic search across several databases such as PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane, Embase and Science Direct using the relevant MeSH terms and keywords like \"albumin\", \"serum albumin\", \"salivary albumin\", \"oral health\" \"dental caries\" and \"epidemiology\". Only the epidemiological studies published between 2010 and 2023 were included. After the application of the inclusion criteria, a total of 51 studied were included in this narrative review. Serum and salivary albumin tests have been used in various aspects of oral health as a diagnostic and prognostic factor. Some of the results point out to a pattern of association while some of them are inconclusive and even contradictory. This narrative review discusses the role, significance and impact of albumin in epidemiological oral health related studies including the categories of periodontal health and disease, dental caries, oral function and hypofunction, nutrition and malnutrition, tooth loss and its treatment, diabetes and cancer. In addition, it offers a short manual for the researchers on when, where and how to use albumin tests in planning their study designs whether investigating an association or measure them as a covariate.\n",
            "ID: 38766274, Title: α-Glucosidase inhibitory potential of <i>Oroxylum indicum</i> using molecular docking, molecular dynamics, and <i>in vitro</i> evaluation., Abstract: According to the International Diabetes Federation, there will be 578 million individuals worldwide with diabetes by 2030 and 700 million by 2045. One of the promising drug targets to fight diabetes is α-glucosidase (AG), and its inhibitors may be used to manage diabetes by reducing the breakdown of complex carbohydrates into simple sugars. The study aims to identify and validate potential AG inhibitors in natural sources to combat diabetes. Computational techniques such as structure-based virtual screening and molecular dyncamic simulation were employed to predict potential AG inhibitors from compounds of <i>Oroxylum indicum</i>. Finally, in silico results were validated by <i>in vitro</i> analysis using <i>n</i>-butanol fraction of crude methanol extracts. The XP glide scores of top seven hits OI_13, OI_66, OI_16, OI_44, OI_43, OI_20, OI_78 and acarbose were -14.261, -13.475, -13.074, -13.045, -12.978, -12.659, -12.354 and -12.296 kcal/mol, respectively. These hits demonstrated excellent binding affinity towards AG, surpassing the known AG inhibitor acarbose. The MM-GBSA dG binding energies of OI_13, OI_66, and acarbose were -69.093, -62.950, and -53.055 kcal/mol, respectively. Most of the top hits were glycosides, indicating that active compounds lie in the <i>n</i>-butanol fraction of the extract. The IC<sub>50</sub> value for AG inhibition by <i>n</i>-butanol fraction was 248.1 μg/ml, and for that of pure acarbose it was 89.16 μg/ml. The predicted oral absorption rate in humans for the top seven hits was low like acarbose, which favors the use of these compounds as anti-diabetes in the small intestine. In summary, the study provides promising insights into the use of natural compounds derived from <i>O. indicum</i> as potential AG inhibitors to manage diabetes. However, further research, including clinical trials and pharmacological studies, would be necessary to validate their efficacy and safety before clinical use.\n",
            "ID: 38766166, Title: Pharmacological inhibition of tyrosine protein-kinase 2 reduces islet inflammation and delays type 1 diabetes onset in mice., Abstract: Tyrosine protein-kinase 2 (TYK2), a member of the Janus kinase family, mediates inflammatory signaling through multiple cytokines, including interferon-α (IFNα), interleukin (IL)-12, and IL-23. Missense mutations in TYK2 are associated with protection against type 1 diabetes (T1D), and inhibition of TYK2 shows promise in the management of other autoimmune conditions. Here, we evaluated the effects of specific TYK2 inhibitors (TYK2is) in pre-clinical models of T1D. First, human β cells, cadaveric donor islets, and iPSC-derived islets were treated <i>in vitro</i> with IFNα in combination with a small molecule TYK2i (BMS-986165 or a related molecule BMS-986202). TYK2 inhibition prevented IFNα-induced β cell HLA class I up-regulation, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and chemokine production. In co-culture studies, pre-treatment of β cells with a TYK2i prevented IFNα-induced activation of T cells targeting an epitope of insulin. <i>In vivo</i> administration of BMS-986202 in two mouse models of T1D ( <i>RIP-LCMV-GP</i> mice and NOD mice) reduced systemic and tissue-localized inflammation, prevented β cell death, and delayed T1D onset. Transcriptional phenotyping of pancreatic islets, pancreatic lymph nodes (PLN), and spleen during early disease pathogenesis highlighted a role for TYK2 inhibition in modulating signaling pathways associated with inflammation, translational control, stress signaling, secretory function, immunity, and diabetes. Additionally, TYK2i treatment changed the composition of innate and adaptive immune cell populations in the blood and disease target tissues, resulting in an immune phenotype with a diminished capacity for β cell destruction. Overall, these findings indicate that TYK2i has beneficial effects in both the immune and endocrine compartments in models of T1D, thus supporting a path forward for testing TYK2 inhibitors in human T1D.\n",
            "ID: 38766090, Title: Network approach reveals preferential T-cell and macrophage association with α-linked β-cells in early stage of insulitis in NOD mice., Abstract: One of the challenges in studying islet inflammation - insulitis - is that it is a transient phenomenon. Traditional reporting of the insulitis progression is based on cumulative, donor-averaged values of leucocyte density in the vicinity of pancreatic islets, that hinders intra- and inter-islet heterogeneity of disease progression. Here, we aimed to understand why insulitis is non-uniform, often with peri-insulitis lesions formed on one side of an islet. To achieve this, we demonstrated applicability of network theory in detangling intra-islet multi-cellular interactions during insulitis. Specifically, we asked the question \"what is unique about regions of the islet which interact with immune cells first\". This study utilized the non-obese diabetic mouse model of type one diabetes and examined the interplay among α-, β-, T-cells, myeloid cells, and macrophages in pancreatic islets during the progression of insulitis. Disease evolution was tracked based on T/β cell ratio in individual islets. In the early stage, we found that immune cells are preferentially interacting with α-cell-rich regions of an islet. At the islet periphery α-linked β-cells were found to be targeted significantly more compared to those without α-cell neighbors. Additionally, network analysis revealed increased T-myeloid, and T-macrophage interactions with all β-cells.\n",
            "ID: 38766042, Title: Effects of Age and Sex on Systemic Inflammation and Cardiometabolic Function in Individuals with Type 2 Diabetes., Abstract: Systemic inflammation, aging, and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) all contribute to the development of cardiovascular dysfunction and impaired aerobic exercise capacity but their interplay remains unclear. This study evaluates the impact of age, sex, and inflammation on coronary and peripheral vascular function and exercise capacity in elderly individuals with and without type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Elderly individuals (age ≥65 years) underwent biochemical and tissue inflammatory phenotyping, cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET), cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging, and vascular reactivity testing. Correlation and regression analyses determined the effects of systemic inflammation, older age, and sex on cardiovascular health, stratified by T2DM status. For the 133 recruited individuals (44% female; median age 71, IQR=7 years, 41% with T2DM) the presence of T2DM did not have an effect on most blood serum inflammatory markers and skin biopsies. Hyperemic myocardial blood flow (hMBF), flow-mediated, and flow-independent nitroglycerin induced brachial artery dilation were significantly impaired in males, but not females with T2DM. Peak VO2 was lower with T2DM (p=0.022), mostly because of the effect of T2DM in females. Females showed more adverse myocardial remodeling assessed by extracellular volume (p=0.008), independent of T2DM status. Our findings suggest that the pathophysiological manifestations of T2DM on vascular function and aerobic exercise capacity are distinct in elderly males and females and this may reflect underlying differences in vascular and myocardial aging in the presence of T2DM.\n",

Retrospective cohort study. 1247 glaucoma surgery and treatment naïve eyes of 626 patients who were initiated on GLP-1R agonists compared to 1083 glaucoma surgery and treatment naïve eyes of 547 patients who were initiated on other oral antidiabetics. The University of California Health Data Warehouse was queried for patients exposed to GLP-1R agonists or other oral antidiabetics. Index date was defined as the date of first exposure to the medication. Eyes with at least one pre-exposure and one post-exposure tonometry record within 365 days of the index date were included in the analysis. Clinical and laboratory data elements were extracted from the database. Eyes were censored from the analysis upon exposure to glaucoma hypotensive medication or glaucoma surgery. ΔIOP was analyzed using a paired t-test. Regression analysis was conducted using generalized estimating equations (GEE) accounting for inter-eye correlation. Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the robustness of the findings. Primary outcome measure was ΔIOP after exposure to the medication. The median age of all included subjects was 66.2 years [IQR=18.3]; 607 (51.7%) were female, and 667 (56.9%) were Caucasian. Median pre-exposure IOP, HbA1c, and BMI were 15.2 mmHg [IQR=3.8], 7.5 [IQR=2.4], and 29.8 [IQR=9.4], respectively. 776 individuals (66.1%) had diabetes, with the median number of active oral antidiabetics being 1.0 [IQR=1.0], and 441 (37.5%) being insulin users. Several pre-exposure characteristics significantly differed between the GLP-1R agonist and the control group. The mean ΔIOP was -0.4±2.8 mmHg (paired t-test p<0.001) and -0.2±3.3 mmHg (paired t-test p = 0.297) in the GLP-1R agonist and other antidiabetics groups, respectively. Pre-exposure IOP was the only independent predictor of ΔIOP in multivariable GEE. Sensitivity analyses yielded similar results. Although GLP-1R agonists were significantly associated with a decrease in IOP in the paired analysis, they were not associated with ΔIOP in multivariable GEE. Moreover, the difference between the ΔIOP in the two groups was small. Future prospective studies following a standardized dose and delivery method may provide further insights.\n",
            "ID: 38765955, Title: Unraveling genetic causality between metformin and myocardial infarction on the basis of Mendelian randomization., Abstract: In recent years, several studies have explored the effect of metformin on myocardial infarction (MI), but whether metformin has an improvement effect in patients with MI is controversial. This study was aimed to investigate the causal relationship between metformin and MI using Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. The genome-wide significant (<i>P</i><5×10<sup>-8</sup>) single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in patients with metformin and patients with MI were screened from the Open genome-wide association study (GWAS) project as instrumental variables (IVs). The study outcomes mainly included MI, old MI, acute MI, acute transmural MI of inferior wall, and acute transmural MI of anterior wall. The inverse variance weighted (IVW) method was applied to assess the main causal effect, and weighted median, simple mode, weighted mode methods, and MR-Egger regression were auxiliary applied for supplementary proof. The causal relationship between metformin and MI was assessed using odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). A leave-one-out method was used to explore the effect of individual SNPs on the results of IVW analyses, and a funnel plot was used to analyze the potential bias of the study results, thus ensuring the robustness of the results. In total, 16, 84, 39, 26, and 34 SNPs were selected as IVs to assess the genetic association between metformin and outcomes of MI, old MI, acute MI, acute transmural MI of inferior wall, and acute transmural MI of anterior wall, respectively. Treatment with metformin does not affect the risk of acute transmural MI of anterior wall at the genetic level (<i>P</i>>0.05; OR for inverse variance weighted was 1.010). In the cases of MI, old MI, acute MI, and acute transmural MI of inferior wall, metformin may even be a risk factor for patients (<i>P</i><0.05; ORs for inverse variance weighted were 1.078, 1.026, 1.022 and 1.018 respectively). There was no horizontal pleiotropy or heterogeneity among IVs. The results were stable when removing the SNPs one by one. Metformin is not protective against the risk of myocardial infarction in patients and may even be a risk factor for MI, old MI, acute MI, and acute transmural MI of inferior wall.\n",

The prevalence of KPD has not been evaluated in children. We investigated children with DKA at \"T2D\" onset and determined the prevalence and characteristics of pediatric <i>A</i><sup>-</sup><i>β</i><sup>+</sup> KPD within this cohort. We reviewed the records of 716 children with T2D at a large academic hospital and compared clinical characteristics of those with and without DKA at onset. In the latter group, we identified patients with <i>A</i><sup>-</sup><i>β</i><sup>+</sup> KPD using criteria of the Rare and Atypical Diabetes Network (RADIANT) and defined its prevalence and characteristics. Mean age at diagnosis was 13.7 ± 2.4 years: 63% female; 59% Hispanic, 29% African American, 9% non-Hispanic White, and 3% other. Fifty-six (7.8%) presented with DKA at diagnosis and lacked islet autoantibodies. Children presenting with DKA were older and had lower C-peptide and higher glucose concentrations than those without DKA. Twenty-five children with DKA (45%) met RADIANT <i>A</i><sup>-</sup><i>β</i><sup>+</sup> KPD criteria. They were predominantly male (64%), African American or Hispanic (96%), with substantial C-peptide (1.3 ± 0.7 ng/mL) at presentation with DKA and excellent long-term glycemic control (HbA1c 6.6% ± 1.9% at follow-up (median 1.3 years postdiagnosis)). In children with a clinical phenotype of T2D and DKA at diagnosis, approximately half meet criteria for <i>A</i><sup>-</sup><i>β</i><sup>+</sup> KPD. They manifest the key characteristics of obesity, preserved <i>β</i>-cell function, male predominance, and potential to discontinue insulin therapy, similar to adults with <i>A</i><sup>-</sup><i>β</i><sup>+</sup> KPD.\n",
            "ID: 38765836, Title: The borderline effect for diabetes: when no difference makes a difference., Abstract: We hypothesized that people at the borderline of being labeled as \"prediabetic\" based on A1c blood test results, who initially face equivalent risks of developing diabetes but who are labeled differently, would be more likely to develop diabetes when labeled as \"prediabetic\" as a result of the label. Study 1 served to establish the psychological effect of the prediabetes label: we surveyed 260 participants on Amazon Mechanical Turk to test whether risk perception significantly increased when comparing A1c test results that differed by 0.1% and led to different diagnostic labels (5.6 and 5.7%) but did not significantly increase when comparing those that differed by 0.1% but received the same label (5.5%/5.6 and 5.7%/5.8%). Study 2 explored whether labels are associated with different rates of developing diabetes when the initial difference in A1c results suggests equivalent risk. Using data from 8,096 patients, we compared patients whose initial A1c results differed by 0.1% and found those who received results labeled as prediabetic (A1c of 5.7%) were significantly more likely to develop diabetes than patients whose initial results were labeled as normal (5.6%). In contrast, patients whose initial results differed by 0.1% but who received the same \"normal\" label (5.5 and 5.6%) were equally likely to develop diabetes. These preliminary results suggest that diagnostic labels may become self-fulfilling, especially when the underlying pathology of patients receiving different labels does not meaningfully differ.\n",

            "ID: 38765810, Title: Current insights into transcriptional role(s) for the nutraceutical <i>Withania somnifera</i> in inflammation and aging., Abstract: The health-beneficial effects of nutraceuticals in various diseases have received enhanced attention in recent years. Aging is a continuous process wherein physiological activity of an individual declines over time and is characterized by various indefinite hallmarks which contribute toward aging-related comorbidities in an individual which include many neurodegenerative diseases, cardiac problems, diabetes, bone-degeneration, and cancer. Cellular senescence is a homeostatic biological process that has an important function in driving aging. Currently, a growing body of evidence substantiates the connection between epigenetic modifications and the aging process, along with aging-related diseases. These modifications are now being recognized as promising targets for emerging therapeutic interventions. Considering that almost all the biological processes are modulated by RNAs, numerous RNA-binding proteins have been found to be linked to aging and age-related complexities. Currently, studies have shed light on the ability of the nutraceutical <i>Withania somnifera</i> (Ashwagandha) to influence RNA expression, stability, and processing, offering insights into its mechanisms of action. By targeting RNA-related pathways, <i>Withania somnifera</i> may exhibit promising effects in ameliorating age-associated molecular changes, which include modifications in gene expression and signaling networks. This review summarizes the potential role of <i>Withania somnifera</i> as a nutraceutical in modulating RNA-level changes associated with aging, encompassing both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> studies. Taken together, the putative role(s) of <i>Withania</i> in modulation of key RNAs will provide insights into understanding the aging process and facilitate the development of various preventive and therapeutic strategies employing nutraceuticals for healthy aging.\n",
            "ID: 38765803, Title: The future of diabetic wound healing: unveiling the potential of mesenchymal stem cell and exosomes therapy., Abstract: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a significant public health problem and is one of the most challenging medical conditions worldwide. It is the severe complications that make this disease more intricate. A diabetic wound is one of these complications. Patients with diabetes are at higher risk of developing diabetic foot ulcers (DFU). Due to the ineffectiveness of Conventional treatments, growth in limb amputation, morbidity, and mortality have been recognized, which indicates the need for additional treatment. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can significantly improve wound healing. However, there are some risks related to stem cell therapy. Exosome therapy is a new treatment option for diabetic wounds that has shown promising results. However, an even more advanced form called cell-free therapy using exosomes has emerged. This upgraded version of stem cell therapy offers improved efficacy and eliminates the risk of cancer progression. Exosome therapy promotes wound healing from multiple angles, unlike traditional methods that primarily rely on the body's self-healing ability and only provide wound protection. Therefore, exosome therapy has the potential to replace conventional treatments effectively. However, further research is necessary to distinguish the optimal type of stem cells for therapy, ensure their safety, establish appropriate dosing, and identify the best management trail. The present study focused on the current literature on diabetic wound ulcers, their treatment, and mesenchymal stem cell and exosome therapy potential in DFU.\n",
            "ID: 38765768, Title: Factors Associated with Patient Education in Patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) - A Primary Health Care Register-Based Study., Abstract: Patient education in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is recommended in treatment strategy documents, since it can improve the ability to cope with the disease. Our aim was to identify the extent of and factors associated with patient education in patients with COPD in a primary health care setting. In this nationwide study, we identified 29,692 COPD patients with a registration in the Swedish National Airway Register (SNAR) in 2019. Data on patient education and other clinical variables of interest were collected from SNAR. The database was linked to additional national registers to obtain data about pharmacological treatment, exacerbations and educational level. Patient education had been received by 44% of COPD patients, 72% of whom had received education on pharmacological treatment including inhalation technique. A higher proportion of patients who had received education were offered smoking cessation support, had performed spirometry and answered the COPD Assessment Test (CAT), compared with patients without patient education. In the adjusted analysis, GOLD grade 2 (OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.18-1.42), grade 3 (OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.27-1.57) and grade 4 (OR 1.79, 95% CI 1.48-2.15), as well as GOLD group E (OR 1.17, 95% CI 1.06-1.29), ex-smoking (OR 1.70, 95% CI 1.56-1.84) and current smoking (OR 1.45, 95% CI 1.33-1.58) were positively associated with having received patient education, while cardiovascular disease (OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.87-0.98) and diabetes (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.87-1.00) were negatively associated with receipt of patient education. Fewer than half of the patients had received patient education, and the education had mostly been given to those with more severe COPD, ex- and current smokers and patients with fewer comorbidities. Our study highlights the need to enhance patient education at an earlier stage of the disease.\n",
            "ID: 38765748, Title: Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio associated with renal function in type 2 diabetic patients., Abstract: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a leading risk factor for the development and progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, an accurate and convenient marker for early detection and appropriate management of CKD in individuals with T2DM is limited. Recent studies have demonstrated a strong correlation between the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and CKD. Nonetheless, the predictive value of NLR for renal damage in type 2 diabetic patients remains understudied. To investigate the relationship between NLR and renal function in T2DM patients. This study included 1040 adults aged 65 or older with T2DM from Shanghai's Community Health Service Center. The total number of neutrophils and lymphocytes was detected, and NLR levels were calculated. CKD was defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate ≤ 60 mL/min/1.73 m². Participants were divided into four groups based on NLR levels. The clinical data and biochemical characteristics were compared among groups. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to analyze the association between NLR levels and CKD. Significant differences were found in terms of sex, serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol among patients with T2DM in different NLR groups (<i>P</i> < 0.0007). T2DM patients in the highest NLR quartile had a higher prevalence of CKD (<i>P</i> for trend = 0.0011). Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that a high NLR was an independent risk factor for CKD in T2DM patients even after adjustment for important clinical and pathological parameters (<i>P</i> = 0.0001, odds ratio = 1.41, 95% confidence intervals: 1.18-1.68). An elevated NLR in patients with T2DM is associated with higher prevalence of CKD, suggesting that it could be a marker for the detection and evaluation of diabetic kidney disease.\n",

Although endoscopic methods are mostly used in its treatment, it has high recurrence rates. Therefore, open urethroplasty is recommended after unsuccessful endoscopic treatments. To investigate the risk factors associated with urethral stricture recurrence. The data of male patients who underwent internal urethrotomy for urethral stricture between January 2017 and January 2023 were retrospectively analyzed. Demographic data, comorbidities, preoperative haemogram, and biochemical values obtained from peripheral blood and operative data were recorded. Patients were divided into two groups in terms of recurrence development; recurrence and non-recurrence. Initially recorded data were compared between the two groups. A total of 303 patients were included in the study. The mean age of the patients was 66.6 ± 13.6 years. The mean duration of recurrence development was 9.63 ± 9.84 (min-max: 1-39) months in the recurrence group. Recurrence did not occur in non-recurrence group throughout the follow-up period with an average time of 44.15 ± 24.07 (min-max: 12-84) months. In the comparison of both groups, the presence of diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HT), and multiple comorbidities were significantly higher in the recurrence (+) group (<i>P</i> = 0.038, <i>P</i> = 0.012, <i>P</i> = 0.013). Blood group, postoperative use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, preoperative cystostomy, cause of stricture, iatrogenic cause of stricture, location and length of stricture, indwelling urinary cathater size and day of catheter removal did not differ between the two groups. No statistically significant difference was observed between the two groups in terms of age, uroflowmetric maximum flow rate value, hemogram parameters, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), fasting blood sugar, creatinine, glomerular filtration rate, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, platelet-lymphocyte ratio, lymphocyte-monocyte ratio, monocyte-lymphocyte ratio and AST/ALT ratios. In patients with urethral stricture recurrence, only the frequency of DM and HT was high, while inflammation marker levels and stricture-related parameters were similar between the groups.\n",
            "ID: 38765732, Title: Household Food Insecurity and Cognition in Youth and Young Adults with Youth-Onset Diabetes., Abstract: We evaluated the association of household food insecurity (FI) with cognition in youth and young adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D) or type 2 diabetes (T2D). In this cross-sectional study, age-adjusted scores for composite Fluid Cognition, and sub-domain scores for Receptive Language and Inhibitory Control and Attention, were modeled stratified by diabetes-type using linear regression, with FI in the past year as the predictor, controlling for covariates. Tests for processing speed, inhibitory control/attention, working memory, episodic memory, and cognitive flexibility were administered to measure composite Fluid Cognition score. The NIHT-CB Picture Vocabulary Test was used to assess Crystallized Cognition score and rapid identification of congruent versus noncongruent items were used to assess Inhibitory Control and Attention score. The SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth study, representative of 5 U.S. states. Included 1574 youth and young adults with T1D or T2D, mean age of 21 years, mean diabetes duration of 11 years, 51% non-Hispanic white, and 47% had higher HbA1c levels (>9% HbA1c). Approximately 18% of the 1,240 participants with T1D and 31% of the 334 with T2D experienced FI. The food-insecure group with T1D had a lower composite Fluid Cognition score (β= -2.5, 95% confidence interval (CI)= -4.8, -0.1) and a lower Crystallized Cognition score (β= -3.4, CI= -5.6, -1.3) than food-secure peers. Findings were attenuated to non-significance after adjustment for demographics. Among T2D participants, no associations were observed. In participants with T1D effect modification by glycemic levels were found in the association between FI and composite Fluid Cognition score but adjustment for socioeconomic characteristics attenuated the interaction (p=0.0531). Food-insecure youth and young adults with T1D or T2D did not have different cognition compared to those who were food-secure after adjustment for confounders. Longitudinal research is needed to further understand relations amongst these factors.\n",
            "ID: 38765731, Title: DNA Methylation Near <i>DLGAP2</i> May Mediate the Relationship between Family History of Type 1 Diabetes and Type 1 Diabetes Risk., Abstract: Given the differential risk of type 1 diabetes (T1D) in offspring of affected fathers versus affected mothers and our observation that T1D cases have differential DNA methylation near the imprinted <i>DLGAP2</i> gene compared to controls, we examined whether methylation near <i>DLGAP2</i> mediates the association between T1D family history and T1D risk. In a nested case-control study of 87 T1D cases and 87 controls from the Diabetes Autoimmunity Study in the Young, we conducted causal mediation analyses at 12 <i>DLGAP2</i> region CpGs to decompose the effect of family history on T1D risk into indirect and direct effects. These effects were estimated from two regression models adjusted for the human leukocyte antigen DR3/4 genotype: a linear regression of family history on methylation (mediator model) and a logistic regression of family history and methylation on T1D (outcome model). For 8 of the 12 CpGs, we identified a significant interaction between T1D family history and methylation on T1D risk. Accounting for this interaction, we found that the increased risk of T1D for children with affected mothers compared to those with no family history was mediated through differences in methylation at two CpGs (cg27351978, cg00565786) in the <i>DLGAP2</i> region, as demonstrated by a significant pure natural indirect effect (odds ratio (OR) = 1.98, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.06-3.71) and nonsignificant total natural direct effect (OR = 1.65, 95% CI: 0.16-16.62) (for cg00565786). In contrast, the increased risk of T1D for children with an affected father or sibling was not explained by DNA methylation changes at these CpGs. Results were similar for cg27351978 and robust in sensitivity analyses. Lastly, we found that DNA methylation in the <i>DLGAP2</i> region was associated (<i>P</i><0:05) with gene expression of nearby protein-coding genes <i>DLGAP2</i>, <i>ARHGEF10</i>, <i>ZNF596</i>, and <i>ERICH1</i>. Results indicate that the maternal protective effect conferred through exposure to T1D <i>in utero</i> may operate through changes to DNA methylation that have functional downstream consequences.\n",
            "ID: 38765694, Title: Secondhand smoke exposure in public outdoor spaces in the Netherlands: The stronger the smell, the more exposure to nicotine., Abstract: While secondhand smoke exposure in outdoor spaces has been investigated before, no data on outdoor secondhand smoke exposure have been collected in the Netherlands. Such data could help policymakers gain support for smoke-free outdoor public spaces. Between May and November 2021, we visited 25 outdoor locations across the Netherlands. At each location, we conducted four measurements with smokers and one measurement without smokers. During each measurement, we counted the number of smokers present and we rated tobacco smell intensity on a five-point scale. Airborne nicotine and 3-ethenylpyridine (3-EP) data were collected through active sampling on thermal desorption tubes. The contents of these tubes were later analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Using linear mixed models, we investigated the association between levels of nicotine and the presence of smokers, the number of smokers, and the intensity of tobacco smell. We also investigated these association with levels of 3-EP. Nicotine levels were higher when smokers were present (B=1.40; 95% CI: 0.69-2.11, p<0.001). For each additional smoker present, we measured higher levels of nicotine (B=0.23; 95% CI: 0.10-0.37, p=0.001). When the smell of tobacco smoke was noted to be stronger by the researchers, higher levels of nicotine were measured through sampling (B=0.85; 95% CI: 0.44-1.26, p<0.001). We found similar results for 3-EP levels. This study showed that both nicotine and 3-EP are useful in quantifying levels of secondhand smoke in various outdoor locations. The level of nicotine exposure outdoors was positively associated with the number of smokers nearby. The intensity of the tobacco smell was also related to nicotine exposure: the stronger the smell of tobacco smoke, the more nicotine was measured in the air.\n",
            "ID: 38765635, Title: A Comprehensive Review on Weight Gain following Discontinuation of Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor Agonists for Obesity., Abstract: Obesity is considered the leading public health problem in the medical sector. The phenotype includes overweight conditions that lead to several other comorbidities that drastically decrease health. Glucagon-like receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) initially designed for treating type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) had demonstrated weight loss benefits in several clinical trials<i>. In vivo</i> studies showed that GLP-1RA encourages reduced food consumption and consequent weight reduction by stimulating brown fat and enhancing energy outlay through the action of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) pathways. Additionally, GLP-1RAs were found to regulate food intake through stimulation of sensory neurons in the vagus, interaction with the hypothalamus and hindbrain, and through inflammation and intestinal microbiota. However, the main concern with the use of GLP-1RA treatment was weight gain after withdrawal or discontinuation. We could identify three different ways that could lead to weight gain. Potential factors might include temporary hormonal adjustment in response to weight reduction, the central nervous system's (CNS) incompetence in regulating weight augmentation owing to the lack of GLP-1RA, and <i>β</i>-cell malfunction due to sustained exposure to GLP-1RA. Here, we also review the data from clinical studies that reported withdrawal symptoms. Although the use of GLP-1RA could be beneficial in multiple ways, withdrawal after years has the symptoms reversed. Clinical studies should emphasize the downside of these views we highlighted, and mechanistic studies must be carried out for a better outcome with GLP-1RA from the laboratory to the bedside.\n",

Association studies between depressive symptoms and blood pressure (BP) have been inconsistent. Home BP monitoring may provide insight. To investigate the association between depressive symptoms and digital home BP. Electronic Framingham Heart Study (eFHS) participants were invited to obtain a smartphone app and digital BP cuff at research exam 3 (2016-2019). Participants with ≥3 weeks of home BP measurements within 1 year were included. Depressive symptoms were measured using the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). Multivariable linear mixed models were used to test the associations of continuous CES-D score and dichotomous depressive symptoms (CES-D ≥16) (independent) with home BP (dependent), adjusting for age, sex, cohort, number of weeks since baseline, lifestyle factors, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Among 883 participants (mean age 54 years, 59% women, 91% White), the median CES-D score was 4. Depressive symptom prevalence was 7.6%. Mean systolic and diastolic BP at exam 3 were 119 and 76 mm Hg; hypertension prevalence was 48%. A 1 SD higher CES-D score was associated with 0.9 (95% CI: 0.18-1.56, <i>P</i> = .01) and 0.6 (95% CI: 0.06-1.07, <i>P</i> = .03) mm Hg higher home systolic BP and diastolic BP, respectively. Dichotomous depressive symptoms were not significantly associated with home BP (<i>P</i> > .2). Depressive symptoms were not associated with clinically substantive levels of home BP. The association between depression and cardiovascular disease risk factors warrants more data, which may be supported by mobile health measures.\n",

The authors aimed to develop and validate a deep learning (DL) model to predict an individual's elevated 10-year ASCVD risk score based on retinal images and limited demographic data. The study used 89,894 retinal fundus images from 44,176 UK Biobank participants (96% non-Hispanic White, 5% diabetic) to train and test the DL model. The DL model was developed using retinal images plus age, race/ethnicity, and sex at birth to predict an individual's 10-year ASCVD risk score using the pooled cohort equation (PCE) as the ground truth. This model was then tested on the US EyePACS 10K dataset (5.8% non-Hispanic White, 99.9% diabetic), composed of 18,900 images from 8969 diabetic individuals. Elevated ASCVD risk was defined as a PCE score of ≥7.5%. In the UK Biobank internal validation dataset, the DL model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.89, sensitivity 84%, and specificity 90%, for detecting individuals with elevated ASCVD risk scores. In the EyePACS 10K and with the addition of a regression-derived diabetes modifier, it achieved sensitivity 94%, specificity 72%, mean error -0.2%, and mean absolute error 3.1%. This study demonstrates that DL models using retinal images can provide an additional approach to estimating ASCVD risk, as well as the value of applying DL models to different external datasets and opportunities about ASCVD risk assessment in patients living with diabetes.\n",

The aim of this study is to clarify the genetic background of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) of unknown etiology who initiated renal replacement therapy (RRT) in adulthood. This is a multicenter cross-sectional cohort study. Of the 1164 patients who attended 4 dialysis clinics in Japan, we first selected patients who started RRT between the ages of 20 and 49 years. After excluding patients with apparent causes of CKD (e.g., diabetic nephropathy, polycystic kidney disease (PKD) with family history, patients who underwent renal biopsy), 90 patients with CKD of unknown cause were included. The 298 genes associated with CKD were analyzed using capture-based targeted next-generation sequencing. Of the 90 patients, 10 (11.1%) had pathogenic variants in CKD-causing genes and 17 (18.9%) had variant of unknown significance (VUS). Three patients had <i>PKD1</i> pathogenic variants, and 1 patient had <i>PKD1</i> and <i>COL4A4</i> pathogenic variants. In addition, 2 patients were diagnosed with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) due to <i>C3</i> or <i>CFHR5</i>. One patient each was diagnosed with Alport syndrome due to <i>COL4A4</i> and <i>COL4A3</i> variants<i>,</i> nephronophthisis due to <i>NPHP1</i> variants, Fabry disease due to <i>GLA</i> variants, and autosomal-dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease due to <i>UMOD</i> variants.

            "ID: 38765600, Title: Alkaline Phosphatase and Parathyroid Hormone Levels: International Variation and Associations With Clinical Outcomes in the DOPPS., Abstract: Secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) increases the risk of fractures and cardiovascular (CV) disease in patients on hemodialysis (HD). The relationship between parathyroid hormone (PTH) and outcomes has been inconsistent, possibly due to variable bone responsiveness to PTH. The KDIGO guideline suggests monitoring total alkaline phosphatase (ALP), but the role of ALP versus PTH in the management of mineral and bone disorder (MBD) is not clear. The analysis included 28,888 patients on HD in 9 countries in Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study (DOPPS) phase 3 to 7 (2005-2021). The primary exposures of interest were normalized ALP and PTH, which are raw values divided by facility upper normal limit, measured at study enrollment. Cox models were used to estimate hazard ratios of all-cause or CV mortality and any or hip fracture adjusted for potential confounders. Linear mixed models, adjusted for potential confounders, were employed to investigate the relationship between normalized ALP levels and patient characteristics. Normalized PTH showed a J-shaped association with all-cause or CV mortality, and a weak linear association with fracture. In contrast, normalized ALP showed a strong association with all outcomes. Factors associated with higher ALP levels after controlling for PTH included Black race, longer dialysis vintage, diabetes mellitus, hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), and the use of cinacalcet. Total ALP is a more robust exposure of adverse outcomes than PTH in patients on HD. PTH responsiveness is affected by race, primary renal disease, comorbidities, and mineral metabolism and therapy. Our results indicate that it may be useful to evaluate target organ response, rather than PTH alone when considering the consequences of (SHPT).\n",
            "ID: 38765561, Title: Calciphylaxis Episodes in the Australia and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant Registry., Abstract: Calciphylaxis is a rare disorder associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Data registries are an invaluable source of information for rare diseases. We reviewed cases of calciphylaxis recorded in the Australia and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant Registry (ANZDATA) and evaluated associations and outcomes of this condition. Data was obtained on all cases of calciphylaxis reported between 2019 and 2022 in Australian and New Zealand patients on kidney replacement therapy (KRT). This cohort was compared to all patients in the registry who received KRT from 2019 to 2022 without an episode of calciphylaxis. Cox proportional hazards regression including a time-varying covariate for calciphylaxis episode was conducted for mortality with models restricted to patients on dialysis only. From 2019 to 2022, 333 patients had calciphylaxis episodes reported. Overall incidence rate for patients on dialysis was 4.5 (4.1-5.1) episodes per 1000 patient-years on dialysis. Median age was 63 (interquartile range [IQR]: 55-73) years, 54% were female, 66% had diabetes, 59% were obese (body mass index [BMI] ≥ 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and 77% were receiving hemodialysis (HD) treatment. Compared to patients without calciphylaxis (<i>n</i> = 46,526), patients with calciphylaxis were more likely to be older, female, and have diabetes, greater BMI, coronary artery, and peripheral vascular disease. The median time to calciphylaxis was 3.2 (IQR: 0.9-6.7) years after KRT commencement. Half of the patients with calciphylaxis died by 12 months from diagnosis. Adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of mortality for patients on dialysis with calciphylaxis <1 year and 1 to 4 years after an episode was 5.8 (4.9-6.9) and 1.5 (1.0-2.1), respectively compared to patients on dialysis without calciphylaxis. Calciphylaxis is a rare but life-threatening condition in people on KRT with the greatest mortality burden within 12 months of diagnosis.\n",
            "ID: 38765560, Title: Protective Role of the Podocyte IL-15 / STAT5 Pathway in Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis., Abstract: During glomerular diseases, podocyte-specific pathways can modulate the intensity of histological disease and prognosis. The therapeutic targeting of these pathways could thus improve the management and prognosis of kidney diseases. The Janus Kinase/Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway, classically described in immune cells, has been recently described in detail in intrinsic kidney cells. We describe STAT5 expression in human kidney biopsies from patients with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and studied mice with a podocyte-specific <i>Stat5</i> deletion in experimental glomerular diseases. Here, we show, for the first time, that STAT5 is activated in human podocytes in FSGS. In addition, podocyte-specific <i>Stat5</i> inactivation aggravates the structural and functional alterations in a mouse model of FSGS. This could be due, at least in part, to an inhibition of autophagic flux. Finally, interleukin 15 (IL-15), a classical activator of STAT5 in immune cells, increases STAT5 phosphorylation in human podocytes, and its administration alleviates glomerular injury <i>in vivo</i> by maintaining autophagic flux in podocytes. Activating podocyte STAT5 with commercially available IL-15 represents a potential new therapeutic avenue for FSGS.\n",

A retrospective cohort study, held in two obstetric units from January 2021- 2022, 34 patients who were confirmed cases of COVID- 19 were followed up till the time of delivery as their placenta were sent for histopathology. Patients diagnosed with other viral infections, chorioamnionitis, or were known case of as pre-term or term pre labour rupture of membrans (PROM) were excluded as well as pre exisiting diabetes mellitus or pre-eclampsia. Data analysis were performed using STATA software version 16. Specific histopatological findings (fetal vascular malperfusion, maternal vascular malperfusion, inflammatory pathology and thrombotic finding) were significantly high among 13 (38.2%) of the study group who got infected earlier in pregnancy (P<0.001). The period between the diagnosis of COVID-19 and the delivery significantly increases the odds of the presence of pathological findings by 2.75 times for each week the patients getting infected earlier. Association of abnormal placental histopathological findings with COVID-19 infection in pregnancy and the potential predictor for the occurrence of placental findings is the longer duration between the diagnosis of the infection and the delivery.\n",
            "ID: 38765485, Title: A Wrist-Worn Internet of Things Sensor Node for Wearable Equivalent Daylight Illuminance Monitoring., Abstract: Light exposure is a vital regulator of physiology and behavior in humans. However, monitoring of light exposure is not included in current wearable Internet of Things (IoT) devices, and only recently have international standards defined [Formula: see text] -optic equivalent daylight illuminance (EDI) measures for how the eye responds to light. This article reports a wearable light sensor node that can be incorporated into the IoT to provide monitoring of EDI exposure in real-world settings. We present the system design, electronic performance testing, and accuracy of EDI measurements when compared to a calibrated spectral source. This includes consideration of the directional response of the sensor, and a comparison of performance when placed on different parts of the body, and a demonstration of practical use over 7 days. Our device operates for 3.5 days between charges, with a sampling period of 30 s. It has 10 channels of measurement, over the range 415-910 nm, balancing accuracy and cost considerations. Measured [Formula: see text]-opic EDI results for 13 devices show a mean absolute error of less than 0.07 log lx, and a minimum between device correlation of 0.99. These findings demonstrate that accurate light sensing is feasible, including at wrist worn locations. We provide an experimental platform for use in future investigations in real-world light exposure monitoring and IoT-based lighting control.\n",

A total of 485 PLWH were enrolled. These participants were categorized into two groups based on the estimated pulse wave velocity (ePWV) level. Demographic and clinical data were collected to investigate the correlation between ePWV and MetS. The cohort of 485 PLWH was categorized into high-ePWV and low-ePWV groups based on ePWV cutoff value of 10 m/s. We observed significant differences in components of MetS including triglycerides (TG, P < 0.05), HDL cholesterol (HDL-C, P < 0.01), systolic blood pressure (SBP, P < 0.001), diastolic blood pressure (DBP, P < 0.05), and fasting plasma glucose (FPG, P < 0.001) between the two groups. Furthermore, we employed receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves to demonstrate the effectiveness of ePWV as a predictive indicator for MetS in PLWH (AUC = 0.739, P < 0.001). According to the ROC curve, the optimal cut-off value of ePWV was 7.4 m/s, and its sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing MetS in PLWH were 79.03% and 64.07%, respectively. Although the 7.4 m/s cutoff increased the false positive rate compared to the traditional cutoff, it significantly reduced the rate of missed diagnoses, effectively identifying 79.03% of PLWH with MetS. ePWV is a non-invasive and convenient novel biomarker with predictive capabilities for MetS in PLWH.\n",

The clinical data of patients with PCT who were hospitalized in the Department of Thyroid Surgery of the Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University from March 2023 to September 2023 were retrospectively collected, including age, gender, height, weight, BMI, v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B (<i>BRAF</i>) gene mutation, tumor size, multifocus, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, lymph node metastasis and other clinicopathological factors. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) definition for Asian population, BMI≥25kg/m<sup>2</sup> was obese group, 23≤BMI≤24.9kg/m<sup>2</sup> was overweight group, 18.5≤BMI≤22.9kg/m<sup>2</sup> was normal weight group, and BMI≤18.5kg/m<sup>2</sup> was low weight group. The clinicopathological factors of overweight and obese patients with PTC were analyzed. A total of 164 PTC patients were included, with an average BMI of (24.44±3.57) kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Age of overweight and obese PTC patients (<i>Z</i>=1.978, <i>p</i>=0.083); Gender of overweight and obese PTC patients (<i>χ</i><sup>2</sup> value: 11.570, <i>p</i>=0.004); Tumor size in overweight and obese PTC patients (<i>Z</i>=0.894, <i>p</i>=0.411); <i>BRAF</i> gene mutation in overweight and obese PTC patients (<i>χ</i><sup>2</sup> value: 1.452, <i>p</i> =0.623); Multifocal lesions were found in overweight and obese patients (<i>χ</i><sup>2</sup> value: 1.653, <i>p</i> =0.201). Hashimoto's thyroiditis was found in overweight and obese PTC patients (<i>χ</i><sup>2</sup> value: 1.147, <i>p</i>=0.298). Overweight and obese patients with PTC had lymph node metastasis (<i>χ</i><sup>2</sup> value: 1.690, <i>p</i> =0.251).

This study aims to characterize the cardiometabolic and metabolic profile of lean/normal, overweight and obese patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease on a big sample. Appeared healthy adults who participated in health examinations during the year of 2019-2022 were screened for fatty liver diagnosis. BMI classified fatty livers as lean, overweight and obese. Eleven cardiometabolic metrics (SBP: systolic blood pressure; DBP: diastolic blood pressure; TC: total cholesterol; TG: triglycerides; HDL: high-density lipoprotein cholesterol; LDL: low-density lipoprotein cholesterol) and metabolic metrics (GLU: blood glucose; GHB: glycated haemoglobin; UA: uric acid; AST: aspartate aminotransferase; ALT: alanine aminotransferase) were included, described and compared among BMI categories. There were 56,496 fatty livers diagnosed by ultrasound in this study. In total, the lean fatty liver had lowest mean SBP, DBP, GLU, TG, UA, AST, and ALT but highest TC and HDL among BMI categories (all p < 0.001). The number of abnormal metrics in total was 2.5, 2.9 and 3.4 in lean, overweight, and obesity, respectively (p < 0.001, p_trend < 0.001). Visualized data showed that lean fatty liver was similar but milder in all metabolic metrics than overweight and obesity at the young ages. However, lean fatty liver had higher coefficients of age and risk of metabolic abnormality regression (p <0.001 for SBP, DBP, GLU, GHB, TC). The lean type of fatty livers at a younger age has a relatively favourable cardiometabolic and metabolic profile compared to overweight and obese fatty livers. Due to the possible catch-up effect of metabolic dysfunctions in young lean fatty liver, lean fatty liver may have the same health outcomes as overweight/obesity fatty liver in long term. The evaluation and intervention may be critical for young lean fatty liver management to slowdown the rapid progress of metabolic dysfunction.\n",
            "ID: 38765466, Title: Racial inequities and rare <i>CFTR</i> variants: Impact on cystic fibrosis diagnosis and treatment., Abstract: Cystic fibrosis (CF) has been traditionally viewed as a disease that affects White individuals. However, CF occurs among all races, ethnicities, and geographic ancestries. The disorder results from mutations in the <i>CF transmembrane conductance regulator</i> (<i>CFTR</i>). Varying incidence of CF is reported among Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC), who typically exhibit worse clinical outcomes. These populations are more likely to carry rare <i>CFTR</i> variants omitted from newborn screening panels, leading to disparities in care such as delayed diagnosis and treatment. In this study, we present a case-in-point describing an individual of Gambian descent identified with CF. Patient genotype includes a premature termination codon (PTC) (c.2353C>T) and previously undescribed single nucleotide deletion (c.1970delG), arguing against effectiveness of currently available CFTR modulator-based interventions. Strategies for overcoming these two variants will likely include combinations of PTC suppressors, nonsense mediated decay inhibitors, and/or alternative approaches (e.g. gene therapy). Investigations such as the present study establish a foundation from which therapeutic treatments may be developed. Importantly, c.2353C>T and c.1970delG were not detected in the patient by traditional <i>CFTR</i> screening panels, which include an implicit racial and ethnic diagnostic bias as these tests are comprised of mutations largely observed in people of European ancestry. We suggest that next-generation sequencing of <i>CFTR</i> should be utilized to confirm or exclude a CF diagnosis, in order to equitably serve BIPOC individuals. Additional epidemiologic data, basic science investigations, and translational work are imperative for improving understanding of disease prevalence and progression, <i>CFTR</i> variant frequency, genotype-phenotype correlation, pharmacologic responsiveness, and personalized medicine approaches for patients with African ancestry and other historically understudied geographic lineages.\n",
            "ID: 38765448, Title: Patient Advocates for Clinical Research (PACER): A Step Toward Ethical, Relevant, and Truly Participatory Clinical Research in India., Abstract: Background Clinical research presents a promising path for improving healthcare in contemporary India. Yet, researchers identify gaps in trust, awareness, as well as misconceptions about being a '\"guinea pig.\" We proposed building the capacity of training patient advocacy groups (PAGs) in patient-centered clinical research and through them creating aware patients as research partners. Methodology Patient Advocates for Clinical Research (PACER) is a tiered program to share information and education about clinical research with PAGs. Tier one is a self-paced online learning course, followed by workshops on clinical research, Good Clinical Practice, research consent, case studies, and group discussions. Results A total of 20 PAGs represented by 48 participants, active in areas of pediatric cancer, breast cancer, multiple myeloma, type I diabetes, spinal muscular atrophy, sickle cell disease, and inflammatory bowel diseases, participated. Among 48 participants 30 successfully completed the online course (multiple-choice question evaluation score cut-off >70%), attaining an average score of 23.9 ± 2.1 out of 30. Overall, 48 participants attended workshop 1 and 45 workshop 2, with 140 participants joining the focus group discussion (FGD). An overall improvement of 9.4% (𝜒<sup>2</sup> = 46.173; p < 0.001) for workshop 1 and 8.2% (𝜒<sup>2</sup> = 25.412; p < 0.001) for workshop 2 was seen in knowledge gain about clinical research. The FGD raised issues such as misleading information from research teams, unethical recruitment, incomprehensible information sheets, and limited trial-related knowledge fostering fear of participation in clinical research. Conclusions Multimodal and tiered learning of clinical research such as that used by PACER has a good participatory and learning response from PAGs and may be further explored.\n",
            "ID: 38765429, Title: Interplay Between Diabetes Mellitus and the Occurrence of Osteoarthritis and Associated Conditions in Women of Menopausal Age., Abstract: Osteoarthritis (OA) and diabetes mellitus (DM) have long-term deleterious chronic effects and are among the most prevalent chronic disorders. DM and its associated factors, such as hyperglycemia, have a significant contribution to the pathophysiology of OA, particularly in post-menopausal women. Women who have uncontrolled diabetes (DM) are more prone to develop osteoarthritis (OA), which may be exacerbated by poor glycemic control. Furthermore, this category of female patients with DM has an increased risk of developing fractures, even in those with initially normal bone density scores, further illustrating the correlation between DM and bone health. Additionally, multiple risk factors, including obesity, metabolic syndrome, hypertension, estrogen-based hormone therapy, and hyperuricemia, in menopausal women can lead to the development and exacerbation of OA. It is discovered that these variables have a direct or indirect impact, frequently causing inflammation and hormonal changes, which contribute to the intricate interaction between DM and OA. The management of OA and DM in women thus calls for a multi-faceted management plan including glycemic control, weight control, exercise, and specialized pain management methods catering to the specific requirements of the patients. Regularly screening for OA should be implemented for menopausal women with DM and utmost care should be provided by healthcare professionals. Regular monitoring of joint health and early management, encouraging interdisciplinary cooperation, putting preventative measures into place, and creating individualized treatment programs are essential. A thorough understanding of the link between DM and OA will ultimately lead to improved health outcomes and a better future for these individuals.\n",

Multiple factors like advanced maternal age, obesity, and unhealthy lifestyle can increase the risk of GDM. The current guidelines recommend screening all pregnant females for risk factors during the first trimester with subsequent testing of the blood glucose level at 24 weeks gestation. Lack of awareness about GDM is a main contributing factor in the delay in screening and diagnosis of GDM with subsequent fetal and maternal complications. This study aims to identify the level of knowledge about GDM among the adult population in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). Material and methods A descriptive cross-sectional questionnaire-based study was conducted to identify the level of knowledge about risk factors, prevention, and treatment of GDM in a community sample from Saudi Arabia. A self-administered electronic questionnaire was designed, tested for validity and reliability, and distributed through social media platforms. It consisted of 18 questions asking about the socio-demographic characteristics, the type of hospital in which the participant receives their medical care, whether the participant heard about GDM or not, and if they know someone with GDM, in addition to questions to assess the level of knowledge about risk factors, complications, prevention, and treatment of GDM. The total score of knowledge was calculated. The multivariate regression analysis test was employed to analyze the relationship between various demographic variables and the level of knowledge about GDM among the study population. A p-value of 0.05 or less was considered statistically significant. Results A total of 539 (100%) participants completed the questionnaire: 263 (48.8%) of them were in the age category (18-25 years), 440 (81.6%) of them were females, 307 (57%) had a bachelor's degree, 275 (51%) were single, 454 (84.2%) had heard about GDM, and 258 (47.9%) of them have or know someone with GDM. The total score of knowledge revealed excellent, good, fair, and poor levels among 334 (62%), 140 (26%), 49 (9%), and 16 (3%) of participants, respectively. The multivariable linear regression model revealed that participants who received health care from governmental hospitals heard about GDM and had or knew someone with GDM were positively associated with a higher level of knowledge. Conclusions The findings revealed that among participants, 62% showed excellent knowledge about GDM, although, the other 38% had non-optimal levels of knowledge. Awareness campaigns are recommended to improve the level of knowledge about this disease, its risk factors, treatment, and complications.\n",

However, it is unknown the extent to which people with chronic illnesses pay attention to nutritional information and act upon the information obtained. We evaluated the menu ordering practices of adults with chronic illnesses. We analyzed the 2018 Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS 5 Cycle 2). Our analytic cohort included 3,154 respondents (weighted population size=228,464,822) who answered questions regarding a personal history of diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, and obesity. They also answered questions about their nutritional habits regarding whether they noticed caloric information at fast-food or sit-down restaurants and how that information influenced their dietary choices. Among respondents with these chronic illnesses, only obese patients were significantly more likely to pay attention to caloric information (OR=1.56; 95%CI: 1.06-2.31). However, noticing the calorie information was not associated with ordering less calories among all categories of respondents with chronic illnesses. US adults with chronic illnesses do not pay sufficient attention to the calorie information of their diet. Furthermore, awareness of the calorie information did not influence their dietary choices. Healthcare professionals should incorporate dietary counseling into the management of chronic illnesses of their patients.\n",

However, the long-term effect of excess GH on the peripheral organs is still unclear. Here we present a 69-year-old man evaluated for the cause of a hypoglycemic episode. He was underweight (body mass index: 17.3 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) with sarcopenia, which potentially contributed to his hypoglycemia. Notably, he exhibited progressed proliferative diabetic retinopathy compared to other microvascular complications, leading to further endocrinological investigation. As a result, he was diagnosed with acromegaly showing elevated GH and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) with a pituitary tumor. Opting against transsphenoidal surgery (TSS), the patient was treated with a somatostatin analog (SSA), achieving normalized IGF-1 levels with a monthly 120 mg lanreotide injection. In this case, acromegaly could lead to sarcopenia from GH-derived gluconeogenesis in the peripheral organs such as the reduction of muscle leading to reduced glucose reserves. Acromegaly in the elderly may present atypicality. Clinicians should be vigilant for unique manifestations such as advanced diabetic retinopathy, even in elderly patients with hypoglycemia.\n",

Two weeks later, he presented with elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) and a nearly obliterated anterior chamber with coagulated blood behind the lens in the RE. We performed two rounds of surgery, including cataract surgery, vitrectomy, and sclerotomy. The choroidal detachment was clearly visible behind the posterior capsule during the cataract surgery. The surgical intervention successfully lowered the IOP and alleviated the pain. In rare cases of SESCH, maintaining awareness when patients show vulnerability in their choroidal vessels is of high importance.\n",

Objectives The aim of this study was to investigate age-related patterns of symptoms and risk factors in ACS patients and to evaluate how diagnostic test results differ among various age groups of ACS patients. Methodology This retrospective study was conducted from May to November of 2023 on patients with acute coronary syndrome admitted to the cardiology ward of Rehman Medical Institute (RMI), Peshawar. The sample size was 137 ACS-diagnosed patients based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. After getting ethical approval from the institutional ethical approval board, data were collected for the entire year of 2022 based on proforma with the variables demographic data, troponin I level, presented symptoms, and associated co-morbidities of the patients. The inclusion criteria were patients of all genders, patients diagnosed with Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS), and patients whose records were available in the cardiology department of Rehman Medical Institute.  Results The results show that ACS is more prevalent in the age group of 50-69 years (p=0.037) and is significantly more common in males (p=0.019). Chest pain emerged as the predominant symptom, with a significant association of p=0.029 between chest pain and patients of ACS in the age group 30-49 years. While raised troponin I levels were prevalent across all age groups. Moreover, specific risk factors such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and family history of CAD showed the significance of p= 0.04, p=0.006, and p=0.021, respectively, with the age group 50-69 years old. Conclusion This study highlights the importance of considering age and gender in ACS management and provides insights into age-related patterns of symptoms and risk factors, which can contribute to optimizing preventive strategies and improving patient care. Further research is needed to explore the underlying mechanisms and assess long-term outcomes in different age groups.\n",
            "ID: 38765344, Title: A Study to Evaluate the Effect of Sodium-Glucose Co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) Inhibitors on Oxidative Stress Parameters in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients., Abstract: Introduction Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a global health issue with 50 million diabetics currently residing in India. Hyperglycemia causes tissue damage due to mitochondrial overproduction of reactive oxygen species. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors (SGLT2i) have shown a decrease in oxidative stress by either amelioration of free-radical generation or potentiation of cellular antioxidative capacity in preclinical studies. However, there is a paucity of published clinical studies. Hence, this study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of co-administration of SGLT2i with other drugs on oxidative stress in type 2 DM (T2DM) patients. Methods A prospective, parallel, open-label study in T2DM patients attending endocrinology OPD was conducted for a period of 12 months. At the clinician's discretion, patients were grouped as SGLT2i as an add-on to standard drugs vs standard drugs alone. Blood samples were collected at baseline and at the end of 12 weeks to estimate malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO), and glutathione (GSH) levels. Secondary parameters - glycemic indices and lipid profile - were estimated every four weeks. Results A total of 32 patients were enrolled in the study (16 per group). There was a significant decrease in MDA (p < 0.05) and NO (p < 0.01) and a highly significant increase in GSH (p < 0.001) at 12 weeks from baseline in the SGLT2i group. A reduction in fasting blood sugar (FBS) and post-prandial blood sugar (PPBS) and a 0.56% difference in HbA1c were also noted in the SGLT2i group. Significant lowering of low-density lipoprotein (LDL, p < 0.05) and elevation in HDL levels (p < 0.05) from baseline was seen in the SGLT2i group.  Conclusion Co-administration of SGLT2i with antidiabetic drugs demonstrated a significant effect in improving oxidative stress biomarkers and glycemic and lipid profiles among T2DM patients.\n",

The distribution of bacteria based on preoperative urine cultures was also analyzed. Statistical analysis was performed using R4.2.2 software. Of the 759 patients, positive preoperative urine culture, urine nitrite positivity, urine white blood cell count (WBC) ≥ 200 cells/μL, residual stones, and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) were found to be independent risk factors for urogenic sepsis after FURL. Among the 164 patients with positive preoperative urine cultures, 32 developed urogenic sepsis post-surgery, with 68.75% having positive preoperative cultures. The leading pathogens causing postoperative urogenic sepsis were <i>Escherichia coli</i> (<i>E. coli</i>), <i>Enterococcus faecium</i>, <i>Proteus mirabilis</i>, and <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i>. The probabilities of progression to urogenic sepsis were as follows: <i>E. coli</i> 19% (<i>n</i> = 12), <i>Enterococcus faecium</i> 43% (<i>n</i> = 3), <i>Proteus mirabilis</i> 33.3% (<i>n</i> = 1), and <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> 33.3% (<i>n</i> = 1). The ages of affected patients were 47.17 ± 13.2, 53.7, 41, and 79 years, respectively. Rates of comorbid diabetes were 36.4, 66.7, 50, 100%, with nitrite positivity rates at 72.7, 33.3, 50, 0%. Ten female patients were infected with <i>E. coli</i>, while patients infected with <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> had an NLR of 7.62. Positive preoperative urine culture, urine nitrite positivity, urine WBC ≥ 200 cells/μL, residual stones, and NLR are independent risk factors for urogenic sepsis after FURL. <i>Escherichia coli</i> is the predominant pathogen post-FURL, with notable female prevalence and nitrite-positive urine in infections. <i>Enterococcus faecium</i> infections are associated with diabetes.\n",
            "ID: 38765207, Title: Exploring the Impact of Iron Deficiency Anaemia on Glycated Haemoglobin A1c Levels in Pregnant and Non-Pregnant Women: A Systematic Review., Abstract: Haemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) is fundamental in monitoring glycaemic control during pregnancy. However, several conditions could affect this test's accuracy, including iron deficiency anaemia (IDA). Hence, this systematic review delves into the underexplored connection between IDA, iron replacement therapy (IRT), and haemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) during pregnancy. An electronic search of the Cochrane, MEDLINE, and Embase databases was conducted by six authors. From a comprehensive search strategy, 968 records were obtained. After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, seven studies were included, comprising 365 women selected for analysis. Six studies indicated a positive correlation between IDA and HbA1c levels, while one found no correlation. The average HbA1c level of the included studies in pregnant women was 5.64%. In comparison, it was found that non-pregnant women had lower HbA1c levels. Among the included studies, the mean HbA1c levels decreased from 5.1% to 4.89% after treating pregnant women with IRT. The review emphasises the complexity of interpreting HbA1c levels in pregnant women with IDA, highlighting the influence of pregnancy-induced physiological changes. In addition, this suggests that HbA1c should not be the sole criterion for diabetes management in pregnant women with IDA. Future research should focus on alternative glycaemic monitoring methods unaffected by IDA.\n",
            "ID: 38765187, Title: Cardiometabolic Disease Staging and Major Adverse Cardiovascular Event Prediction in 2 Prospective Cohorts., Abstract: Cardiometabolic risk prediction models that incorporate metabolic syndrome traits to predict cardiovascular outcomes may help identify high-risk populations early in the progression of cardiometabolic disease. The purpose of this study was to examine whether a modified cardiometabolic disease staging (CMDS) system, a validated diabetes prediction model, predicts major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). We developed a predictive model using data accessible in clinical practice [fasting glucose, blood pressure, body mass index, cholesterol, triglycerides, smoking status, diabetes status, hypertension medication use] from the REGARDS (REasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke) study to predict MACE [cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and/or nonfatal stroke]. Predictive performance was assessed using receiver operating characteristic curves, mean squared errors, misclassification, and area under the curve (AUC) statistics. Among 20,234 REGARDS participants with no history of stroke or myocardial infarction (mean age 64 ± 9.3 years, 58% female, 41% non-Hispanic Black, and 18% diabetes), 2,695 developed incident MACE (13.3%) during a median 10-year follow-up. The CMDS development model in REGARDS for MACE had an AUC of 0.721. Our CMDS model performed similarly to both the ACC/AHA 10-year risk estimate (AUC 0.721 vs 0.716) and the Framingham risk score (AUC 0.673). The CMDS predicted the onset of MACE with good predictive ability and performed similarly or better than 2 commonly known cardiovascular disease prediction risk tools. These data underscore the importance of insulin resistance as a cardiovascular disease risk factor and that CMDS can be used to identify individuals at high risk for progression to cardiovascular disease.\n",
            "ID: 38765173, Title: Novel strategy: Identifying new markers for demyelination in diabetic distal symmetrical polyneuropathy., Abstract: To develop a novel strategy for identifying acquired demyelination in diabetic distal symmetrical polyneuropathy (DSP). Motor nerve conduction velocity (CV) slowing in diabetic DSP exceeds expectations for pure axonal loss thus implicating superimposed acquired demyelination. After establishing demyelination confidence intervals by regression analysis of nerve conduction data from chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), we prospectively studied CV slowing in 90 diabetic DSP patients with and without at least one motor nerve exhibiting CV slowing (groups A and B) into the demyelination range by American Academy of Neurology (AAN) criteria respectively and 95 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients. Simultaneously, secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) activity was assessed in both diabetic groups and 46 healthy controls. No ALS patient exhibited CV slowing in more than two motor nerves based on AAN criteria or the confidence intervals. Group A demonstrated a significantly higher percentage of patients as compared to group B fulfilling the above criteria, with an additional criterion of at least one motor nerve exhibiting CV slowing in the demyelinating range and a corresponding F response in the demyelinating range by AAN criteria (70.3 % <i>vs.</i> 1.9 %; p < 0.0001). Urine sPLA2 activity was increased significantly in diabetic groups as compared to healthy controls (942.9 ± 978.0 <i>vs.</i> 591.6 ± 390.2 pmol/min/ml, p < 0.05), and in group A compared to Group B (1328.3 ± 1274.2 <i>vs.</i> 673.8 ± 576.9 pmol/min/ml, p < 0.01). More patients with elevated sPLA2 activity and more than 2 motor nerves with CV slowing in the AAN or the confidence intervals were identified in group A as compared to group B (35.1 % <i>vs.</i> 5.7 %, p < 0.001). Furthermore, 13.5 % of patients in diabetic DSP Group A, and no patients in diabetic DSP Group B, fulfilled an additional criterion of more than one motor nerve with CV slowing into the demyelinating range with its corresponding F response into the demyelinating range by AAN criteria. A combination of regression analysis of electrodiagnostic data and a urine biological marker of systemic inflammation identifies a subgroup of diabetic DSP with superimposed acquired demyelination that may respond favorably to immunomodulatory therapy.\n",
            "ID: 38765169, Title: N-glycosylation of immunoglobulin A in children and adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus., Abstract: To identify N-glycan structures on immunoglobulin A related to type 1 diabetes mellitus among children at the disease onset and adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Human polyclonal IgA N-glycans were profiled using hydrophilic interaction ultra performance liquid chromatography in two cohorts. The first cohort consisted of 62 children at the onset of type 1 diabetes mellitus and 86 of their healthy siblings. The second cohort contained 84 adults with the disease and 84 controls. Associations between N-glycans and type 1 diabetes mellitus were tested using linear mixed model for the paediatric cohort, or general linear model for the adult cohort. False discovery rate was controlled by Benjamini-Hochberg method modified by Li and Ji. In children, an increase in a single oligomannose N-glycan was associated with type 1 diabetes mellitus (B = 0.529, p = 0.0067). N-glycome of the adults displayed increased branching (B = 0.466, p = 0.0052), trigalactosylation (B = 0.466, p = 0.0052), trisialylation (B = 0.629, p < 0.001), and mannosylation (B = 0.604, p < 0.001). The strongest association with the disease was a decrease in immunoglobulin A core fucosylation (B = -0.900, p < 0.001). Changes in immunoglobulin N-glycosylation patterns in type 1 diabetes point to disruptions in immunoglobulin A catabolism and dysregulated inflammatory capabilities of the antibody, potentially impacting immune responses and inflammation.\n",
            "ID: 38765055, Title: Towards Integrated Care for the Elderly: Exploring the Acceptability of Telemonitoring for Hypertension and Type 2 Diabetes Management., Abstract: Telemonitoring has been proposed as an effective method to support integrated care for older people with hypertension and type 2 diabetes. This paper examines acceptability of telemontioring, its role in supporting integrated care, and identifies scale-up barriers. A concurrent triangulation mixed-methods study, including in-depth interviews (n = 29) and quantitative acceptability tool (n = 55) was conducted among individuals who underwent a 12-month telemonitoring routine. The research was guided by the Theoretical Framework of Acceptability. Interviews were analysed using template content analysis (TCA). TCA identified seven domains of acceptability, with twenty-one subthemes influencing it positively or negatively. In the quantitative survey, acceptability was high across all seven domains with an overall score of 4.4 out of 5. Urban regions showed higher acceptability than rural regions (4.5 vs. 4.3), with rural participants perceiving initial training and participation effort as significantly more burdensome than their urban counterparts. Patients described several instances where telemonitoring supported self-management, education, treatment, and identification elements of the integrated care package. However, there were barriers that may limit its further scale-up. For further scale-up, it is important to screen patients for monitoring eligibility, adapt telemonitoring devices to elderly needs, combine telemonitoring with health education, involve family members, and establish follow-up programmes.\n",
            "ID: 38765038, Title: Chronic kidney disease progression in diabetic patients: Real world data in general practice., Abstract: the aim of the study was to analyze glomerular filtration ratio (GFR) changes in diabetic patients assisted by General Practitioners (GPs) evaluating the risk factors related to glomerular function. patients with diabetes with at least three recorded values of creatinine were recruited in the study and GFR values were estimated. The quarterly percentage change in GFR for each patient was estimated. Nephrotoxic drugs were identified, and glucose-lowering drugs use was described. Linear regression analyses were performed to identify eGFR changes predictors. a total of 545 patients with diabetes were selected. According to the last eGFR values 64 (11.7 %) patients were classified in G1 stage, 277 (50,8 %) in G2, 175 (32.1 %) in G3a, 25 (4.6 %) in G3b and only 4 (0.7 %) in G4. Patients treated with at least one glucose-lowering drugs were 479 (87.9 %), most of them with biguanides (67.0 %). At least one nephrotoxic drug prescription was recorded in 524 (96.1 %) patients; proton pump inhibitors (74.7 %) and NSAIDs (71.6 %) were the most prescription classes. Heart failure, diabetes duration and preserved GFR values were related to reduced eGFR values. patients with diabetes should be more carefully observed regardless of kidney risk factors and GFR values in clinical practice.\n",
            "ID: 38765022, Title: Integrating Network Pharmacology and Molecular Docking Approach to Elucidate the Mechanism of <i>Commiphora wightii</i> for the Treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis., Abstract: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is considered a notable prolonged inflammatory condition with no proper cure. Synovial inflammation and synovial pannus are crucial in the onset of RA. The \"tumor-like\" invading proliferation of new arteries is a keynote of RA. Commiphora wightii (<i>C wightii</i>) is a perennial, deciduous, and trifoliate plant used in several areas of southeast Asia to cure numerous ailments, including arthritis, diabetes, obesity, and asthma. Several <i>in vitro</i> investigations have indicated <i>C wightii's</i> therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of arthritis. However, the precise molecular action is yet unknown. In this study, a network pharmacology approach was applied to uncover potential targets, active therapeutic ingredients and signaling pathways in <i>C wightii</i> for the treatment of arthritis. In the groundwork of this research, we examined the active constituent-compound-target-pathway network and evaluated that (Guggulsterol-V, Myrrhahnone B, and Campesterol) decisively donated to the development of arthritis by affecting tumor necrosis factor (TNF), PIK3CA, and MAPK3 genes. Later on, docking was employed to confirm the active components' efficiency against the potential targets. According to molecular-docking research, several potential targets of RA bind tightly with the corresponding key active ingredient of <i>C wightii.</i> With the aid of network pharmacology techniques, we conclude that the signaling pathways and biological processes involved in <i>C wightii</i> had an impact on the prevention of arthritis. The outcomes of molecular docking also serve as strong recommendations for future research. In the context of this study, network pharmacology combined with molecular docking analysis showed that <i>C wightii</i> acted on arthritis-related signaling pathways to exhibit a promising preventive impact on arthritis. These results serve as the basis for grasping the mechanism of the antiarthritis activity of <i>C wightii</i>. However, further <i>in vivo</i>/<i>in vitro</i> study is needed to verify the reliability of these targets for the treatment of arthritis.\n",

This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the existing literatures concerning the relationship between the gut microbiota and autoimmune diseases, shedding light on the complex interplay between the gut microbiota, the host and the immune system. Furthermore, we aim to summarize the impacts and potential mechanisms that underlie the interactions between the gut microbiota and the host in autoimmune diseases, primarily focusing on systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, Sjögren's syndrome, type 1 diabetes mellitus, ulcerative colitis and psoriasis. The present review will emphasize the clinical significance and potential applications of interventions based on the gut microbiota as innovative adjunctive therapies for autoimmune diseases.\n",
            "ID: 38764987, Title: Success of Insulin Infusion Transitions in Moderate to Severe Diabetic Ketoacidosis With Transition Anion Gap of Less Than or Equal to 12 mEq/L Versus Greater Than 12 mEq/L., Abstract: <b>Background:</b> Patients with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) are transitioned from intravenous (IV) to subcutaneous (SQ) insulin upon DKA resolution. Although an anion gap (AG) ≤12 mEq/L is recommended before transition to SQ insulin, there are limited data to support this threshold. <b>Objective:</b> To compare the rates of successful transitions to SQ insulin in patients with DKA with an AG ≤ 12 mEq/L versus > 12 mEq/L. <b>Methods:</b> Retrospective cohort study of adult critically ill patients with moderate to severe DKA between September 2019 and December 2022. The primary outcome was the success of insulin transition between patients transitioned with an AG ≤ 12 mEq/L and those transitioned with an AG > 12 mEq/L. Transition was considered successful if the AG did not increase above the value at transition at 24 hours and insulin infusion was not restarted. Secondary outcomes include the individual components of the primary outcome and ICU length of stay (LOS); safety outcomes included hypoglycemia and electrolyte derangements. <b>Results:</b> In total, 92 patients were included, with 43 patients transitioned at AG ≤ 12 mEq/L and 49 patients transitioned at AG > 12 mEq/L. Transition was unsuccessful in 3 patients (7%) with AG ≤ 12 mEq/L and 2 patients (4%) with AG > 12 mEq/L (<i>P</i> = .66). There was no difference in the incidence of the individual components of this outcome between groups or in safety outcomes. <b>Conclusion:</b> This retrospective study showed no difference in success of insulin transition between the groups. Larger studies are needed to evaluate the impact of treatment characteristics on transition success and patient outcomes.\n"
