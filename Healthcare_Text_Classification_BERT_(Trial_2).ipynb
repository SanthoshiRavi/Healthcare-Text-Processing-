            "ID: 38768161, Title: Design of a bi-directional methodology for automated assessment of compliance to continuous application of clinical guidelines, and its evaluation in the type 2 diabetes domain., Abstract: We introduce a new approach for automated guideline-based-care quality assessment, the bidirectional knowledge-based assessment of compliance (BiKBAC) method, and the DiscovErr system, which implements it. Our methodology compares the guideline's Asbru-based formal representation, including its intentions, with the longitudinal medical record, using a top-down and bottom-up approach. Partial matches are resolved using fuzzy temporal logic. The system was evaluated in the type 2 Diabetes management domain, comparing it to three expert clinicians, including two diabetes experts. The system and the experts commented on the management of 10 patients, randomly selected from 2,000 diabetes patients. On average, each record spanned 5.23 years; the data included 1,584 medical transactions. The system provided 279 comments. The experts made 181 different unique comments. The completeness (recall) of the system was 91% when the gold standard was comments made by at least two of the three experts, and 98%, compared to comments made by all three experts. The experts also assessed all of the 114 medication-therapy-related comments, and a random 35% of the 165 tests-and-monitoring-related comments. The system's correctness (precision) was 81%, compared to comments judged as correct by both diabetes experts, and 91%, compared to comments judged as correct by one diabetes expert and at least as partially correct by the other. 89% of the comments were judged as important by both diabetes experts, 8% were judged as important by one expert, and 3% were judged as less important by both experts. Adding the validated system comments to the experts' comments, the completeness scores of the experts were 75%, 60%, and 55%; the expert correctness scores were respectively 99%, 91%, and 88%. Thus, the system could be ranked first in completeness and second in correctness. We conclude that systems such as DiscovErr can effectively assess the quality of continuous guideline-based care.\n",
            "ID: 38768121, Title: Exploring the path to optimal diabetes care by unravelling the contextual factors affecting access, utilisation, and quality of primary health care in West Africa: A scoping review protocol., Abstract: The prevalence of diabetes in West Africa is increasing, posing a major public health threat. An estimated 24 million Africans have diabetes, with rates in West Africa around 2-6% and projected to rise 129% by 2045 according to the WHO. Over 90% of cases are Type 2 diabetes (IDF, World Bank). As diabetes is ambulatory care sensitive, good primary care is crucial to reduce complications and mortality. However, research on factors influencing diabetes primary care access, utilisation and quality in West Africa remains limited despite growing disease burden. While research has emphasised diabetes prevalence and risk factors in West Africa, there remains limited evidence on contextual influences on primary care. This scoping review aims to address these evidence gaps. Using the established methodology by Arksey and O'Malley, this scoping review will undergo six stages. The review will adopt the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Extension for Scoping Review (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines to ensure methodological rigour. We will search four electronic databases and search through grey literature sources to thoroughly explore the topic. The identified articles will undergo thorough screening. We will collect data using a standardised data extraction form that covers study characteristics, population demographics, and study methods. The study will identify key themes and sub-themes related to primary healthcare access, utilisation, and quality. We will then analyse and summarise the data using a narrative synthesis approach. The findings and conclusive report will be finished and sent to a peer-reviewed publication within six months. This review protocol aims to systematically examine and assess the factors that impact the access, utilisation, and standard of primary healthcare services for diabetes in West Africa.\n",
            "ID: 38768080, Title: A national audit of facilities, human and material resources for the comprehensive management of diabetes in Ghana-A 2023 update., Abstract: The human and material resources as well as the systems for managing diabetes in Africa are inadequate. This study or needs assessment, aimed at updating the human and material resources, identifying the gaps and unmet needs for comprehensive diabetes care in Ghana. We conducted a national audit of 122 facilities in all 16 administrative regions of Ghana. Information obtained covered areas on personnel and multidisciplinary teams, access to medications, access to laboratory services, financing, screening services, management of diabetes complications, and availability/use of diabetes guidelines or protocols. Data was analysed using STATA version 16.1. P-values <0.05 were set as significant. Only 85(69.7%) out of the 122 surveyed facilities had a dedicated centre or service for diabetes care. Twenty-eight (23%) had trained diabetes doctors/specialists; and whilst most centres had ophthalmic nurses and dieticians, majority of them did not have trained diabetes educators (nurses), psychologists, ophthalmologists, podiatrists, and foot/vascular surgeons. Also, 13.9% had monofilaments, none could perform urine dipstick for microalbumin; 5 (4.1%) and just over 50% could perform laboratory microalbumin estimation and glycated haemoglobin, respectively. Access to and supply of human insulins was better than analogue insulin in most centres. Nearly 100% of the institutions surveyed had access to metformin and sulphonylurea with good to excellent supply in most cases, whilst access to Sodium Glucose Transporter-2 inhibitors and Glucagon-like peptide-1 analogues were low, and moderate for Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors and thiazolidinediones. Majority of the health facilities (95.1%) offered NHIS as payment mechanism for clients, whilst 68.0% and 30.3% of the patients paid for services using out-of-pocket and private insurance respectively. Fifteen facilities (12.3%) had Diabetes Support Groups in their locality and catchment areas. An urgent multisectoral collaboration, including prioritisation of resources at the facility level, to promote and achieve acceptable comprehensive diabetes care is required.\n",
            "ID: 38768058, Title: Metabolic dysregulation in obese women and the carcinogenesis of gynecological tumors: A review., Abstract: Obesity is a significant health issue associated with increased cancer risks, including gynecological malignancies. The worldwide rise in obesity rates is significantly impacting both cancer development and treatment outcomes. Adipose tissue plays a crucial role in metabolism, secreting various substances that can influence cancer formation. In obese individuals, dysfunctional adipose tissue can contribute to cancer development through inflammation, insulin resistance, hormonal changes, and abnormal cholesterol metabolism. Studies have shown a strong correlation between obesity and gynecological cancers, particularly endometrial and breast cancers. Obesity not only increases the risk of developing these cancers but is also associated with poorer outcomes. Additionally, obesity affects the perioperative management of gynecological cancers, requiring specialized care due to increased complications and resistance to therapy. Treatment strategies for managing metabolic dysregulation in patients with gynecological cancers include weight management, statin therapy, and insulin-sensitizing medications. Emerging studies suggest that interventions like intermittent fasting and caloric restriction may enhance the effectiveness of cancer treatments. Furthermore, targeting cholesterol metabolism, such as with statins or proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors, shows potential in cancer therapy. In conclusion, addressing metabolic issues, particularly obesity, is crucial in preventing and treating gynecological malignancies. Personalized approaches focusing on weight management and metabolic reprogramming may improve outcomes in these patients.\n",
            "ID: 38768051, Title: Fractures in Patients With Diabetes Mellitus: Findings From a 20-year Registry at a Single Level 1 Trauma Center., Abstract: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a risk factor of infection. Although DM has been associated with worse functional outcomes after acetabular fracture, literature regarding the effect of DM on surgical site infection and other early complications is lacking. A 20-year registry from a level 1 trauma center was queried to identify 134 patients with DM and 345 nondiabetic patients with acetabular fractures. The diabetic patient population was older (57.2 versus 43.2; P < 0.001) and had higher average body mass index (33.6 versus 29.5; P < 0.001). Eighty-three patients with DM and 270 nondiabetics were treated surgically (62% versus 78%; P < 0.001). Diabetic patients who were younger (54.6 versus 61.4; P = 0.01) with fewer comorbidities (1.7 versus 2.2; P = 0.04) were more frequently managed surgically. On univariate analysis, patients with DM more commonly developed any early infection (28.4% versus 21%; P = 0.049) but were no more likely to develop surgical site infection, or other postoperative complications. Older patient age, length of stay, baseline pulmonary disease, and concurrent abdominal injury were independent predictors of postoperative infection other than surgical site infection. Diabetics that developed infection had more comorbidities (2.4 versus 1.5; P < 0.001) and higher Injury Severity Score (24.1 versus 15.8; P = 0.003), and were more frequently insulin-dependent (72.7% versus 41%; P = 0.01). Independent of management strategy, diabetic patients were more likely to develop an infection after acetabular fracture. Insulin dependence was associated with postoperative infection on univariate analysis. Optimal selection of surgical candidates among patients with DM may limit postoperative infections.\n",
            "ID: 38767849, Title: ASSOCIATION OF MACULAR STRUCTURE WITH MICROPERIMETRY SENSITIVITY FOLLOWING VITRECTOMY FOR PROLIFERATE DIABETIC RETINOPATHY., Abstract: To evaluate macular sensitivity using microperimetry in patients with proliferate diabetic retinopathy following vitrectomy and to investigate the relationship between the sensitivity and foveal microstructures with optical coherence tomography/angiography. Eighty-four eyes of 84 patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy, who were indicated for vitrectomy, had no intraocular surgery history 3 months preoperatively, and were able to ensure fundus examination after the vitrectomy, were included. A logMAR best-corrected visual acuity, macular sensitivity of microperimetry, macular retinal thickness, and macular vessel perfusion using optical coherence tomography/angiography were examined at 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months postoperatively. The logMAR best-corrected visual acuity and mean macular sensitivity of patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy improved postoperatively (P < 0.05). There was a significant correlation between best-corrected visual acuity and mean sensitivity (P < 0.05). Postoperative mean macular sensitivity was significantly correlated with outer retinal thickness in the 0 to 6 mm macular area (P < 0.05) and also significantly correlated with deep capillary plexus perfusion (P < 0.05). Fixation stability and mean macular sensitivity did not show any correlation with glycated hemoglobin, triglyceride, serum total cholesterol, carbamide, and creatinine and duration of diabetes mellitus (P > 0.05). Postoperative mean macular sensitivity was significantly correlated with outer retinal thickness and deep capillary plexus perfusion for patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy. The authors found that the visual performance of patients can be evaluated by the outer retinal thickness and deep capillary plexus perfusion, so optical coherence tomography/angiography examination can be an important prognostic factor for visual performance in patients.Clinical Trial Registration: This trial is registered with the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (http://www.chictr.org.cn; Registration No.: ChiCTR2100043399).\n",
            "ID: 38767826, Title: Dietary Modulations in Preventing Cardiometabolic Risk in Individuals with Type 2 Diabetes., Abstract: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a complex health issue include obesity, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and chronic inflammation that increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). CVDs are of great concern in the disease progression and prognosis of T2DM. This review is a comprehensive examination of the literature on the relationship between T2DM and cardiovascular risk, nutrition-related cardiometabolic risk (CMR) factors, and impact of dietary modulations on CMR. In recent years the researches has been focus on the importance of a comprehensive treatment approach like dietary modulations to address multiple cardiovascular risk reductions, including hypertension and dyslipidemia. Modulation of dietary patterns are the most promising interventions to prevent CMR factors and T2DM via affecting the body weight, glucose control, and microbial diversity of individuals. Current evidence suggests that high-quality dietary patterns such as the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan and the Mediterranean diet is important in the metabolic control processes of T2DM with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant compounds, glucagon-like peptide agonist compounds, and intestinal microbiota changes. Nutrition plays a critical role in preventing and improving CVD outcomes in patients with T2DM. Dietary modulations should be planned considering individual differences in responses to dietary composition and nutritional changes, personal preferences, eating behaviors and gut microbiota differences.\n",
            "ID: 38767675, Title: Open questions on basal insulin therapy in T2D: a Delphi consensus., Abstract: The revolution in the therapeutic approach to type 2 diabetes (T2D) requires a rethinking of the positioning of basal insulin (BI) therapy. Given the considerable number of open questions, a group of experts was convened with the aim of providing, through a Delphi consensus method, practical guidance for doctors. A group of 6 experts developed a series of 29 statements on: the role of metabolic control in light of the most recent guidelines; BI intensification strategies: (1) add-on versus switch; (2) inertia in starting and titrating; (3) free versus fixed ratio combination; basal-bolus intensification and de-intensification strategies; second generation analogues of BI (2BI). A panel of 31 diabetologists, by accessing a dedicated website, assigned each statement a relevance score on a 9-point scale. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method was adopted to assess the existence of disagreement among participants. Panelists showed agreement for all 29 statements, of which 26 were considered relevant, one was considered not relevant and two were of uncertain relevance. Panelists agreed that the availability of new classes of drugs often allows the postponement of BI and the simplification of therapy. It remains essential to promptly initiate and titrate BI when required. BI should always, unless contraindicated, be started in addition to, and not as a replacement, for ongoing treatments with cardiorenal benefits. 2BIs should be preferred for their pharmacological profile, greater ease of self-titration and flexibility of administration. In a continuously evolving scenario, BI therapy still represents an important option in the management of T2D patients.\n",
            "ID: 38767674, Title: Assessment of genetic and clinical factors in T2D susceptibility among patients with hypertension., Abstract: Hypertension (HTN) and Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) often coexist, therefore understanding the relationship between both diseases is imperative to guide targeted prevention/therapy. This study aims to explore the relationship between HTN and T2D using genome-wide association study (GWAS) analysis and biochemical data to understand the implication of both clinical and genetic factors in these pathologies. A total of 2,876 patients were enrolled. Using GWAS and biochemical data, patients with both T2D and HTN were compared to patients with only HTN. Specificity was confirmed by testing the detected genetic variants for associations with HTN development in T2D patients, or with HTN in healthy subjects. Regression models were applied to examine the association of T2D in patients with HTN with cardiovascular risk factors. Replication was performed using UK Biobank dataset with 31,170 subjects. Data showed that females with HTN are at higher risk of developing T2D due to dyslipidemia, while males faced higher risk due to high BMI (body mass index) and family history of T2D. GWAS identified Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) linked to T2D in patients with HTN. Notably, rs7865889, rs7756992, and rs10896290 were positively associated with T2D, whereas rs12737517 yielded negative association. Three SNPs were replicated in the UK Biobank (rs10896290, rs7865889, and rs7756992). Incorporating clinical and genetic screening into risk assessment is important for the detection and prevention of T2D in patients with HTN. The detected SNPs (rs7865889, rs12737517, and rs10896290), especially the protective SNP (rs12737517), provide an opportunity for better diagnosis, prevention, and therapy of patients with T2D and HTN.\n",
            "ID: 38767646, Title: Characteristics and quality of clinical practice guidelines for diabetic kidney disease: a systematic review., Abstract: To assess the quality of Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) in the context of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) and determine whether any factors affect the quality. We searched eight databases along with five international and national organizations to develop or archive guidelines from their inception to July 2023, with an additional search of medlive.cn. And the authoritative organizations related to nephrology. CPGs and consensus statements created using direct differential diagnosis or therapy for DKD were included without language restrictions. Their quality was evaluated by four reviewers using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation Ⅱ (AGREE Ⅱ) instrument. Along with the item and domain scores, the guideline was also allocated an overall quality score, which ranged from 1 (lowest possible quality) to 7 (highest possible quality). Moreover, an overall recommendation for use was also assigned (\"recommended\", \"recommended with modifications\" or \"not recommended\"). A total of 16 CPGs were included, of which 14 were from Asia and the remaining two from Europe. These two CPGs were updated in the third version. Six CPGs were recommended for use because their primary domains scored in the medium or high category. Furthermore, five CPGs were recommended with modifications as the stakeholder involvement, applicability, and editorial independence domains were evaluated as low categories. In all domains, the lowest average score was for rigour of development (33%), followed by application (36%), and stakeholder involvement (51%). The highest average score was for scope and purpose (79%), followed by clarity of presentation (75%). None of the CPGs considered the patient's viewpoint, and six of 16 CPGs did not use any grading system to translate the evidence into recommendations. Additionally, only three of 16 CPGs shared search strategy, and eight of 16 CPGs did not declare a funding source. According to the AGREE II evaluation, more than one in four CPGs for DKD had poor methodological quality. Enhanced efforts are needed to advance the rigour of development, application, and editorial independence of DKD guideline panels for most guidelines. Stakeholders, CPG developers, and CPG users should consider methodological quality while choosing CPGs, and interpret and implement their issued suggestions.\n",
            "ID: 38767642, Title: Distribution of Traditional Chinese Medicine syndromes in diabetic kidney disease chronic kidney disease 1-5: a correlation study., Abstract: To analyze the distribution of Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) syndromes in patients with diabetic kidney disease (DKD) and its related factors. We enrolled 435 patients with DKD, who were not undergoing dialysis, admitted to the Department of Nephrology, First Medical Center, Chinese PLA General Hospital from April 2020 to August 2021. Analysis of their TCM syndromes and related factors was carried out. The 435 patients included 109, 117, 86, and 123 chronic kidney disease (CKD) 1-2, CKD3, CKD4, and CKD5 cases, respectively. With the progression of CKD1-5, the proportion of <i>Yin</i> deficiency and dry heat syndrome, and that of <i>Qi</i> and <i>Yin</i> deficiency syndrome showed a downward trend, whereas the proportion of spleen-kidney <i>Yang</i> deficiency, blood deficiency, blood stasis, water stagnation, and phlegm turbidity syndromes showed an upward trend; the differences were statistically significant (<i>P</i> < 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that <i>Yin</i> deficiency and dry heat syndrome was positively correlated with hemoglobin [odds ratio (<i>OR</i>) = 1.022, <i>P</i> = 0.005], albumin (<i>OR</i> = 1.058, <i>P =</i> 0.006), and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (<i>OR</i> = 1.020, <i>P <</i> 0.001) but negatively correlated with male sex (<i>OR</i> = 0.277, <i>P =</i> 0.004). <i>Qi</i> and <i>Yin</i> deficiency syndrome was positively correlated with albumin (<i>OR</i> = 1.056, <i>P</i> < 0.001) and eGFR (<i>OR</i> = 1.008, <i>P</i> = 0.022) but negatively correlated with age (<i>OR</i> = 0.977, <i>P</i> = 0.023). Liver-kidney <i>Yin</i> deficiency syndrome was positively correlated with age (<i>OR</i> = 1.028, <i>P =</i> 0.021) and glycosylated hemoglobin (<i>OR</i> = 1.223, <i>P =</i> 0.007) but negatively correlated with total cholesterol (<i>OR</i> = 0.792, <i>P</i> = 0.006). Spleen-kidney <i>Yang</i> deficiency syndrome was negatively correlated with hemoglobin (<i>OR</i> = 0.977, <i>P</i> < 0.001), albumin (<i>OR</i> = 0.891, <i>P</i> < 0.001), and eGFR (<i>OR</i> = 0.978, <i>P</i> < 0.001) but positively correlated with high density lipoprotein (<i>OR</i> = 3.376, <i>P</i> = 0.001).

            "ID: 38767350, Title: Changes in the type 2 diabetes gut mycobiome associate with metformin treatment across populations., Abstract: The human gut teems with a diverse ecosystem of microbes, yet non-bacterial portions of that community are overlooked in studies of metabolic diseases firmly linked to gut bacteria. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) is associated with compositional shifts in the gut bacterial microbiome and the mycobiome, the fungal portion of the microbiome. However, whether T2D and/or metformin treatment underpins fungal community changes is unresolved. To differentiate these effects, we curated a gut mycobiome cohort spanning 1,000 human samples across five countries and validated our findings in a murine experimental model. We use Bayesian multinomial logistic normal models to show that T2D and metformin both associate with shifts in the relative abundance of distinct gut fungi. T2D is associated with shifts in the Saccharomycetes and Sordariomycetes fungal classes, while the genera <i>Fusarium</i> and <i>Tetrapisipora</i> most consistently associate with metformin treatment. We confirmed the impact of metformin on individual gut fungi by administering metformin to healthy mice. Thus, metformin and T2D account for subtle, but significant and distinct variation in the gut mycobiome across human populations. This work highlights for the first time that metformin can confound associations of gut fungi with T2D and warrants the need to consider pharmaceutical interventions in investigations of linkages between metabolic diseases and gut microbial inhabitants. This is the largest to-date multi-country cohort characterizing the human gut mycobiome, and the first to investigate potential perturbations in gut fungi from oral pharmaceutical treatment. We demonstrate the reproducible effects of metformin treatment on the human and murine gut mycobiome and highlight a need to consider metformin as a confounding factor in investigations between type 2 diabetes mellitus and the gut microbial ecosystem.\n",
            "ID: 38767331, Title: Decoding the complexity of delayed wound healing following <i>Enterococcus faecalis</i> infection., Abstract: Wound infections are highly prevalent and can lead to delayed or failed healing, causing significant morbidity and adverse economic impacts. These infections occur in various contexts, including diabetic foot ulcers, burns, and surgical sites. <i>Enterococcus faecalis</i> is often found in persistent non-healing wounds, but its contribution to chronic wounds remains understudied. To address this, we employed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on infected wounds in comparison to uninfected wounds in a mouse model. Examining over 23,000 cells, we created a comprehensive single-cell atlas that captures the cellular and transcriptomic landscape of these wounds. Our analysis revealed unique transcriptional and metabolic alterations in infected wounds, elucidating the distinct molecular changes associated with bacterial infection compared to the normal wound healing process. We identified dysregulated keratinocyte and fibroblast transcriptomes in response to infection, jointly contributing to an anti-inflammatory environment. Notably, <i>E. faecalis</i> infection prompted a premature, incomplete epithelial-mesenchymal transition in keratinocytes. Additionally, <i>E. faecalis</i> infection modulated M2-like macrophage polarization by inhibiting pro-inflammatory resolution in vitro, in vivo, and in our scRNA-seq atlas. Furthermore, we discovered macrophage crosstalk with neutrophils, which regulates chemokine signaling pathways, while promoting anti-inflammatory interactions with endothelial cells. Overall, our findings offer new insights into the immunosuppressive role of <i>E. faecalis</i> in wound infections.\n",
            "ID: 38767130, Title: Immediate response to intravitreal treatment for macular edema due to diabetes and retinal vein occlusion., Abstract: To objectively assess the immediate response to intravitreal treatment for macular edema and compare it across different agents. This retrospective, comparative study included patients with macular edema due to diabetic retinopathy (DME) or vein occlusion who were treated with intravitreal injections of either steroids (triamcinolone acetonide or dexamethasone sustained release implant) or anti-vascular endothelial growth factor antibodies (VEGF). The central retinal thickness (CRT) and the best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) were measured 1 day after the injection and compared with immediate pre-injection values. There were 79 eyes (57 patients) including 51 eyes with DME, 18 with branch retinal vein occlusion edema (BRVO-ME), and 10 eyes with central retinal vein occlusion edema (CRVO-ME). The intravitreal agents were triamcinolone acetonide (TA)(<i>n</i> = 15), dexamethasone sustained release implant (DEX)(<i>n</i> = 22), ranibizumab (<i>n</i> = 19), and bevacizumab (<i>n</i> = 23). Statistically significant improvement in CRT was seen in all injection groups (<i>p</i> < 0.05) while improvement in mean BCVA was significant only in the TA group (<i>p</i> = 0.009). The mean change in CRT was maximum with steroids than with anti-VEGFs; viz. 159.47 µ in TA, 115.45 µ in DEX, 86.10 µ in ranibizumab, and 78.78 µ in bevacizumab group. Least amount of change was noted in the spongy type of macular edema (18.73 µ) while improvement in mean BCVA was statistically significant only in the cystoid group (<i>p</i> = 0.01). Comparatively, steroid agents showed better immediate response to therapy than anti-VEGFs. Maximum reduction in central retinal thickness was seen following triamcinolone acetonide injection. Cystoid edema showed better immediate response than spongy retinal thickening.\n",
            "ID: 38767128, Title: Severe dawn phenomenon predicts long-term risk of all-cause mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes., Abstract: The dawn phenomenon (DP) is an abnormal early morning blood glucose rise without nocturnal hypoglycaemia, which can be more easily and precisely assessed with continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). This prospective study aimed to explore the association between DP and the risk of all-cause mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes. A total of 5542 adult inpatients with type 2 diabetes in a single centre were analysed. The magnitude of DP (ΔG) was defined as the increment in the CGM-determined glucose value from nocturnal nadir (after 24:00) to prebreakfast. Participants were stratified into four groups by ΔG: ≤1.11, 1.12-3.33, 3.34-5.55, and >5.55 mmol/L. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to evaluate the impact of DP on all-cause mortality risk. During a median follow-up of 9.4 years, 1083 deaths were identified. The restricted cubic spline revealed a nonlinear (p for nonlinearity = 0.002) relationship between ΔG and the risk of all-cause mortality. A multivariate-adjusted Cox regression model including glycated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) showed that ΔG > 5.55 mmol/L was associated with 30% (95% CI, 1.01-1.66) higher risk of all-cause mortality, as compared with ΔG 1.12-3.33 mmol/L. Higher ΔG is significantly related to an increased risk of all-cause mortality in type 2 diabetes, suggesting that severe DP should be given more attention as a part of glucose management to reduce the risk of long-term adverse outcomes.\n",
            "ID: 38767114, Title: Androgens Modulate the Immune Profile in a Mouse Model of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome., Abstract: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is associated with a low-grade inflammation, but it is unknown how hyperandrogenism, the hallmark of PCOS, affects the immune system. Using a PCOS-like mouse model, it is demonstrated that hyperandrogenism affects immune cell populations in reproductive, metabolic, and immunological tissues differently in a site-specific manner. Co-treatment with an androgen receptor antagonist prevents most of these alterations, demonstrating that these effects are mediated through androgen receptor activation. Dihydrotestosterone (DHT)-exposed mice displayed a drastically reduced eosinophil population in the uterus and visceral adipose tissue (VAT). A higher frequency of natural killer (NK) cells and elevated levels of IFN-γ and TNF-α are seen in uteri of androgen-exposed mice, while NK cells in VAT and spleen displayed a higher expression level of CD69, a marker of activation or tissue residency. Distinct alterations of macrophages in the uterus, ovaries, and VAT are also found in DHT-exposed mice and can potentially be linked to PCOS-like traits of the model. Indeed, androgen-exposed mice are insulin-resistant, albeit unaltered fat mass. Collectively, it is demonstrated that hyperandrogenism causes tissue-specific alterations of immune cells in reproductive organs and VAT, which can have considerable implications on tissue function and contribute to the reduced fertility and metabolic comorbidities associated with PCOS.\n",

Its effectiveness and tolerability as an addition to metformin, DPP4 inhibitor and insulin treatment in type 2 diabetic patients will be examined in this research. Participants with type 2 diabetes from poor socio-economic backgrounds had HbA1c values ≥8.5% when using Insulin+Metformin+DPP-4 inhibitors. They received 10mg Empagliflozin daily for 12 weeks (n=143). The main outcome was change in HbA1c at 12<sup>th</sup> week from baseline. Secondary outcomes were baseline weight and week 12 FPG. Adjusted mean (SE) HbA1c increases at week 12 were: Mean ± SD 10.38 (6.8-17.0) vs. Mean±SD 9.05±1.77 (5.60-16.0) with empagliflozin 10mg. When added to the regimen, empagliflozin significantly reduced FPG, systolic and diastolic blood pressure. The mean (SE) BMI increases from baseline were 31.28±5.89 (16.0-66.0) and 29.73±5.47 (3.0-46.0) with 10mg empagliflozin. Two individuals experienced urinary tract infections as AEs, but no genital infections. Adding empagliflozin 10mg daily to metformin+DPP4 inhibitor+insulin improved glycemic control, body weight and blood pressure for 12 weeks. The intervention was well-tolerated, highlighting empagliflozin's therapeutic potential.\n",

Diabetes is considered one of the major risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. The current research is designed to evaluate the cardioprotective effects of dapagliflozin in streptozotocin and isoproterenol-induced comorbid rats. The COX-2, TNF-α, NF-КB, NLRP3, PPAR-γ, CKMB, TROP-I, AR, GP and SGLT were docked against dapagliflozin, propranolol and metformin. Dapagliflozin restored adequate blood flow and halted myofibril damage. Moreover, it's evident from this study that dapagliflozin significantly decreased serum concentration of various blood markers, decreased relative growth rate and QT interval prolongation, as compared to the negative control group. However, it improved the ventricular ejection fraction in rats of the treatment group. The GST, GSH and CAT levels were increased, as compared to normal. On the contrary, a decrease in LPO concentrations was observed. Evaluation of the coronal section of heart tissues showed the anti-inflammatory expressions evaluated through H & E staining and immunohistochemical techniques and with ELISA and PCR. In a nutshell, dapagliflozin reverses myocardial necrosis and apoptosis.\n",

The diabetic condition was evaluated using Streptozotocin's oral glucose tolerance test, diabetes-alloxan and diabetes-models. Antiulcer activities were observed in rats where gastric ulcers were either caused by oral administration of ethanol, or pyloric ligation. Standards include ranitidine, glibenclamide and sucralfate. In all models, the blood glucose levels of animals treated with the test extract were found to be significantly lower compared to diabetic care. Similarly, in all models, the ulcer index in the animals treated with the test extract was found to be significantly lower relative to the animals under vehicle supervision. Our findings say T. Spathacea extract has essential anti-diabetic properties, as well as antiulcer properties.\n",

Glimepiride (GLIM), as a drug of choice in the treatment of diabetes mellitus (DM), has the risk of decreasing the functioning of organs such as the kidneys, liver and pancreas. Black rice bran ethanol extract (EEBRB) with antioxidant content has been shown to protect the kidney, liver and pancreas organs. The aim of this study was to establish the effect of EEBRB on lowering fasting blood glucose (FBG) and protecting several organs after GLIM administration in alloxan (ALX)-induced hyperglycemic rats. A total of 20 rats were divided into 4 groups and treated for 21 days treatments using following preparations: normal control (NC), diabetic group (DC), GLIM 1 mg/ kgBW and combination of glimepiride 1mg/kgBW and EEBRB 50 mg/KgBW (GLBR). The results showed that the GLBR was able to lower blood glucose levels back to normal (<126 mg/dL) and protect kidney, liver and pancreas cells by increasing the amount in normal cells.\n",

A selective and sensitive UPLC MS/MS approach was developed for determining mangiferin in diabetic rats. Employing acetonitrile protein precipitation, chromatographic separation utilized a 2.1×50 mm, 3.5μm C<sub>18</sub> column with a mobile phase of 0.1% formic acid aqueous and 5mM ammonium acetate (A, 45%) and acetonitrile (B, 55%) at a 0.5mL min<sup>-1</sup> flow rate. Quantification, employing the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode, focused on precursor-to-product ion transitions at m/z 447.1→271.1 for baicalin m/z and 421.0→301.0 for mangiferin. Calibration curves demonstrated linearity in the 1.00~100ng/mL range, with a lower quantification limit for rat plasma set at 1.00ng/mL. Inter- and intra-day accuracies spanned -9.1% to 8.5% and mangiferin mean recovery varied from 82.3% to 86.7%. The adeptly utilized UPLC-MS/MS approach facilitated the exploration of mangiferin pharmacokinetics in diabetic rats.\n",

This review aims to highlight these new findings and implications to patient care. Postsurgical hypoparathyroidism remains the most common cause, immune-related hypoparathyroidism from checkpoint inhibitors is an emerging autoimmune cause. In a large retrospective cohort study of thyroidectomies, incident fracture was lower, particularly in the vertebra, in the hypoPTH cohort, compared with postthyroidectomy control group. Hypercalciuria increases risk for renal calculi in hypoPTH independent of disease duration and treatment dose. Quality of life is impaired in hypoPTH patients on conventional therapy, improvement was noted post-PTH replacement. TranCon PTH phase 3 RCT reported eucalcemia with reduced renal calcium excretion, normalization of bone turn-over markers, stable BMD and improved quality of life. HypoPTH is a chronic disease associated with significant morbidity and poor Quality of Life. Awareness of treatment targets and follow-up investigations can alleviate patient anxiety regarding over-treatment and under-treatment. Progress in long-acting PTH replacement strategies might provide accessible, feasible alternatives to conventional therapy in brittle hypoPTH patients.\n",

            "ID: 38766907, Title: Pembrolizumab-induced type 1 diabetes., Abstract: Immunotherapy has a crucial role in the current treatment of multiple malignancies. Albeit described as rare, new onset autoimmune diabetes is a potentially life-threatening complication of programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) inhibitors, such as pembrolizumab, and its predisposing factors and pathological mechanism are yet to be clarified. We present a case of a 72-year-old man with a high-grade bladder carcinoma undergoing pembrolizumab treatment. He had no personal or family history of diabetes mellitus but was diagnosed with primary hypothyroidism four months after starting pembrolizumab. Two years after starting pembrolizumab, he presented in the emergency department due to abdominal pain, anorexia, polydipsia, polyuria and vomiting over the preceding five days and he met criteria for severe diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Three days prior to his admission, he had received prednisolone therapy for suspected hypersensitivity related to a contrast-enhanced imaging that he performed. Prompt treatment for DKA was started, with transition to insulin basal-bolus therapy after DKA resolution, with progressive glycaemic stabilization. Further investigation revealed low C-peptide levels (0.07 ng/dL, with a fasting blood glucose of 288 mg/dL), HbA1c 9.2% and positive anti-IA2 antibodies, which allowed the diagnosis of new-onset autoimmune diabetes. Pembrolizumab was transiently suspended, and the patient resumed treatment after glycaemic profile optimization under multiple daily insulin administrations two months later. This case highlights the importance of clinical suspicion and glycaemic monitoring as an integral part of treatment protocols in patients on pembrolizumab and other immune checkpoint inhibitors. Additional research and investigation into the underlying mechanisms of this condition are necessary to identify potential screening tests for individuals at higher risk of developing DM and to guide the implementation of management and preventive strategies for ketoacidosis complication.\n",

The present review aims to narrate the clinical guidelines and therapeutic interventions for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) patients. Furthermore, the present work summarizes the ongoing phase 1/2/3 and clinical trials against T2DM. A meticulous and comprehensive literature review was performed using various databases, such as PubMed, MEDLINE, Clinical trials database (https://clinicaltrials.gov/), and Google Scholar, to include various clinical trials and therapeutic interventions against T2DM. Based on our findings, we concluded that most T2DM-associated clinical trials are interventional. Anti-diabetic therapeutics, including insulin, metformin, Dipeptidyl Peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor Agonists (GLP-1RAs), and Sodium- Glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors are frontline therapeutics being clinically investigated. Currently, the therapeutics in phase IV clinical trials are mostly SGLT-2 inhibitors, implicating their critical contribution to the clinical management of T2DM. Despite the success of T2DM treatments, a surge in innovative treatment options to reduce diabetic consequences and improve glycemic control is currently ongoing. More emphasis needs to be on exploring novel targeted drug candidates that can offer more sustained glycemic control.\n",

The single-blind, randomized, sham-controlled clinical trial was conducted between January 2019 and October 2019. Twenty-four type 2 diabetics (8 males, 16 females; mean age: 60.4±8.9 years; range, 40 to 78 years) with peripheral neuropathy were randomly allocated to control (n=12) and study (n=12) groups. The study group received the capacitive Tecar therapy with 10 to 30% intensity and infrared radiation in 10 sessions. The controls received the same protocol with zero intensity. The neuropathy symptoms and nerve conduction velocity were evaluated at baseline, after 10 sessions, and six weeks after the end of sessions. There were no significant differences in variables (p>0.05). In this way, the homogeneity of the data variables was confirmed. Moreover, the results of two-way mixed analysis of variance showed that improvement of neuropathy symptoms in the study group was significantly more than controls in all stages (p<0.001). After 10 sessions, the results of post hoc analysis showed that the neuropathy symptoms and tibial nerve conduction velocity were significantly improved in both groups (p<0.05). However, there was no change in these outcomes after six weeks in the control group (p>0.05). Tecar therapy could improve neuropathy symptoms and tibial nerve conduction velocity in diabetic individuals with peripheral neuropathy. Therefore, the use of this method to control the symptoms of diabetic patients can be recommended.\n",

The complications of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), especially vestibular dysfunction (VD), could decrease balance performance and falls-efficacy (FE) which consequently impacts social participation and quality of life (QoL). This study aimed to compare balance performance, FE, social participation and QoL between individuals with T2DM with and without VD. The participants comprised 161 T2DM with VD and 161 without VD. Three clinical tests used for confirming VD included the Head Impulse Test (HIT), the Dix Hallpike Test (DHT) and the Supine Roll Test (SRT). The scores of static and dynamic balances, FE, social participation and QoL were compared between groups. The balance performance, FE, social participation and QoL were lower in the group with VD. The number of patients who had severe social restriction was higher in T2DM with VD than without VD (58.4% <i>vs</i> 48.4%). Moreover, all domains of QoL (physical, psychological, social relationships and environmental) were lower in T2DM with VD than without VD. The presence of VD in T2DM patients was associated with decreased physical balance performances and increased social and QoL disengagement. Comprehensive management related to balance and FE, as well as the monitoring to support social participation and QoL, should be emphasized in patients with T2DM with VD.\n",

Over the past century, insulin formulations have undergone significant modifications and bioengineering, resulting in a diverse range of available insulin products. These products show distinct pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles. Consequently, various insulin regimens have em-erged for the management of type 2 diabetes, including premixed formulations and combinations of basal and bolus insulins. The utilization of different insulin regimens yields disparate clinical outcomes, adverse events, and, notably, patient-reported outcomes (PROs). PROs provide valuable insights from the patient's perspective, serving as a valuable mine of information for enhancing healthcare and informing clinical decisions. Adherence to insulin therapy, a critical patient-reported outcome, significantly affects clinical outcomes and is influenced by multiple factors. This review provides insights into the clinical effectiveness of various insulin preparations, PROs, and factors impacting insulin therapy adherence, with the aim of enhancing healthcare practices and informing clinical decisions for individuals with type 2 diabetes.\n",

To investigate whether Huangma Ding or autologous platelet-rich gel (APG) treatment would benefit diabetic lower extremity arterial disease (LEAD) patients with foot ulcers. A total of 155 diabetic LEAD patients with foot ulcers were enrolled and divided into three groups: Group A (62 patients; basal treatment), Group B (38 patients; basal treatment and APG), and Group C (55 patients; basal treatment and Huangma Ding). All patients underwent routine follow-up visits for six months. After follow-up, we calculated the changes in all variables from baseline and determined the differences between groups and the relationships between parameters. The infection status of the three groups before treatment was the same. Procalcitonin (PCT) improved after APG and Huangma Ding treatment more than after traditional treatment and was significantly greater in Group C than in Group B. Logistic regression analysis revealed that PCT was positively correlated with total amputation, primary amputation, and minor amputation rates. The ankle-brachial pressure and the transcutaneous oxygen pressure in Groups B and C were greater than those in Group A. The major amputation rate, minor amputation rate, and total amputation times in Groups B and C were lower than those in Group A. Our research indicated that diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) lead to major amputation, minor amputation, and total amputation through local infection and poor microcirculation and macrocirculation. Huangma Ding and APG were effective attreating DFUs. The clinical efficacy of Huangma Ding was better than that of autologous platelet gel, which may be related to the better control of local infection by Huangma Ding. This finding suggested that in patients with DFUs combined with coinfection, controlling infection is as important as improving circulation.\n",
            "ID: 38766440, Title: Impact of tibial transverse transport in tissue regeneration and wound healing with perspective on diabetic foot ulcers., Abstract: In this editorial, we comment on an article by Liao <i>et al</i> published in the current issue of the <i>World Journal of Diabetes</i>. We focus on the clinical significance of tibial transverse transport (TTT) as an effective treatment for patients with diabetic foot ulcers (DFU). TTT has been associated with tissue regeneration, improved blood circulation, reduced amputation rates, and increased expression of early angiogenic factors. Mechanistically, TTT can influence macrophage polarization and growth factor upregulation. Despite this potential, the limitations and conflicting results of existing studies justify the need for further research into its optimal application and development. These clinical implications highlight the efficacy of TTT in recalcitrant DFU and provide lasting stimuli for tissue re-generation, and blood vessel and bone marrow improvement. Immunomodulation <i>via</i> systemic responses contributes to its therapeutic potential. Future studies should investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms to enhance our understanding and the efficacy of TTT. This manuscript emphasizes the potential of TTT in limb preservation and diabetic wound healing and suggests avenues for preventive measures against limb amputation in diabetes and peripheral artery disease. Here, we highlight the clinical significance of the TTT and its importance in healing DFU to promote the use of this technique in tissue regeneration.\n",
            "ID: 38766439, Title: Synaptotagmins family affect glucose transport in retinal pigment epithelial cells through their ubiquitination-mediated degradation and glucose transporter-1 regulation., Abstract: Synaptotagmins (SYTs) are a family of 17 membrane transporters that function as calcium ion sensors during the release of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent neurotransmitters and hormones. However, few studies have reported whether members of the SYT family play a role in glucose uptake in diabetic retinopathy (DR) through Ca<sup>2+</sup>/glucose transporter-1 (GLUT1) and the possible regulatory mechanism of SYTs. To elucidate the role of the SYT family in the regulation of glucose transport in retinal pigment epithelial cells and explore its potential as a therapeutic target for the clinical management of DR. DR was induced by streptozotocin in C57BL/6J mice and by high glucose medium in human retinal pigment epithelial cells (ARPE-19). Bioinformatics analysis, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, Western blot, flow cytometry, ELISA, HE staining, and TUNEL staining were used for analysis. Six differentially expressed proteins (SYT2, SYT3, SYT4, SYT7, SYT11, and SYT13) were found between the DR and control groups, and SYT4 was highly expressed. Hyperglycemia induces SYT4 overexpression, manipulates Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx to induce GLUT1 fusion with the plasma membrane, promotes abnormal expression of the glucose transporter GLUT1 and excessive glucose uptake, induces ARPE-19 cell apoptosis, and promotes DR progression. Parkin deficiency inhibits the proteasomal degradation of SYT4 in DR, resulting in SYT4 accumulation and enhanced GLUT1 fusion with the plasma membrane, and these effects were blocked by oe-Parkin treatment. Moreover, dysregulation of the myelin transcription factor 1 (Myt1)-induced transcription of SYT4 in DR further activated the SYT4-mediated stimulus-secretion coupling process, and this process was inhibited in the oe-MYT1-treated group. Our study reveals the key role of SYT4 in regulating glucose transport in retinal pigment epithelial cells during the pathogenesis of DR and the underlying mechanism and suggests potential therapeutic targets for clinical DR.\n",

Luo's study demonstrated the efficacy of customized nutritional therapies in controlling GDM. Tailored strategies led to significant body weight loss, improved glucolipid metabolism, and fewer prenatal and newborn problems. This holistic approach, which emphasizes the notion of 'chrononutrition', takes into account optimal meal timing that is in sync with circadian rhythms, as well as enhanced sleep hygiene. Implementing tailored dietary therapy, managing meal timing, and ensuring appropriate sleep may improve results for women with GDM, opening up a possible avenue for multi-center trials.\n",
            "ID: 38766434, Title: Estrogen restores disordered lipid metabolism in visceral fat of prediabetic mice., Abstract: Visceral obesity is increasingly prevalent among adolescents and young adults and is commonly recognized as a risk factor for type 2 diabetes. Estrogen [17β-estradiol (E2)] is known to offer protection against obesity <i>via</i> diverse me-chanisms, while its specific effects on visceral adipose tissue (VAT) remain to be fully elucidated. To investigate the impact of E2 on the gene expression profile within VAT of a mouse model of prediabetes. Metabolic parameters were collected, encompassing body weight, weights of visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissues (VAT and SAT), random blood glucose levels, glucose tolerance, insulin tolerance, and overall body composition. The gene expression profiles of VAT were quantified utilizing the Whole Mouse Genome Oligo Microarray and subsequently analyzed through Agilent Feature Extraction software. Functional and pathway analyses were conducted employing Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analyses, respectively. Feeding a high-fat diet (HFD) moderately increased the weights of both VAT and SAT, but this increase was mitigated by the protective effect of endogenous E2. Conversely, ovariectomy (OVX) led to a significant increase in VAT weight and the VAT/SAT weight ratio, and this increase was also reversed with E2 treatment. Notably, OVX diminished the expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism compared to HFD feeding alone, signaling a widespread reduction in lipid metabolic activity, which was completely counteracted by E2 administration. This study provides a comprehensive insight into E2's local and direct protective effects against visceral adiposity in VAT at the gene level. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that the HFD-induced over-nutritional challenge disrupted the gene expression profile of visceral fat, leading to a universally decreased lipid metabolic status in E2 deficient mice. E2 treatment effectively reversed this condition, shedding light on the mechanistic role and therapeutic potential of E2 in combating visceral obesity.\n",
            "ID: 38766433, Title: Glucokinase regulatory protein rs780094 polymorphism is associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and nephropathy., Abstract: In this editorial, we comment on the article by Liu <i>et al</i> published in the recent issue of the <i>World Journal of Diabetes</i> (Relationship between GCKR gene rs780094 polymorphism and type 2 diabetes with albuminuria). Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic disorder characterized by dysregulated glucose homeostasis. The persistent elevated blood glucose level in T2DM significantly increases the risk of developing severe complications, including cardiovascular disease, re-tinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy. T2DM arises from a complex interplay between genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors. Global genomic studies have identified numerous genetic variations associated with an increased risk of T2DM. Specifically, variations within the glucokinase regulatory protein (GCKR) gene have been linked to heightened susceptibility to T2DM and its associated complications. The clinical trial by Liu <i>et al</i> further elucidates the role of the GCKR rs780094 polymorphism in T2DM and nephropathy development. Their findings demonstrate that individuals carrying the CT or TT genotype at the GCKR rs780094 locus are at a higher risk of developing T2DM with albuminuria compared to those with the CC genotype. These findings highlight the importance of genetic testing and risk assessment in T2DM to develop effective preventive strategies and personalized treatment plans.\n",

To evaluate the risk of infection in patients with T2DM treated with dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors. Electronic databases were searched. The selection criteria included randomized controlled trials focused on cardiovascular outcomes. In these studies, the effects of DPP-4 inhibitors were directly compared to those of either other active anti-diabetic treatments or placebo. Six trials involving 53616 patients were deemed eligible. We calculated aggregate relative risks employing both random-effects and fixed-effects approaches, contingent upon the context. The application of DPP-4 inhibitors showed no significant link to the overall infection risk [0.98 (0.95, 1.02)] or the risk of serious infections [0.96 (0.85, 1.08)], additionally, no significant associations were found with opportunistic infections [0.69 (0.46, 1.04)], site-specific infections [respiratory infection 0.99 (0.96, 1.03), urinary tract infections 1.02 (0.95, 1.10), abdominal and gastrointestinal infections 1.02 (0.83, 1.25), skin structure and soft tissue infections 0.81 (0.60, 1.09), bone infections 0.96 (0.68, 1.36), and bloodstream infections 0.97 (0.80, 1.18)]. This meta-analysis of data from cardiovascular outcome trials revealed no heightened infection risk in patients undergoing DPP-4 inhibitor therapy compared to control cohorts.\n",
            "ID: 38766430, Title: Increasing dietary fiber intake for type 2 diabetes mellitus management: A systematic review., Abstract: Type 2 diabetes is a chronic, non-communicable disease with a substantial global impact, affecting a significant number of individuals. Its etiology is closely tied to imbalanced dietary practices and sedentary lifestyles. Conversely, increasing die-tary fiber (DF) intake has consistently demonstrated health benefits in numerous studies, including improvements in glycemic control and weight management. To investigate the efficacy of DF interventions in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). A systematic literature review was conducted to explore the association between DF intake and the management of T2DM. Following the inclusion and exclusion criteria, a total of 26 studies were included in this review. The main strategies implied to increased DF intake were: High DF diet plus acarbose (2 studies); DF supplements (14 studies); and high DF diets (10 studies). Overall, most studies indicated that increased DF intake resulted in im-provements in glycemic control and weight management in T2DM patients. DF represents a valuable strategy in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, improving health outcomes. DF intake offers the potential to improve quality of life and reduce complications and mortality associated with diabetes. Likewise, through supplements or enriched foods, DF contributes significantly to the control of several markers such as HbA1c, blood glucose, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein, and body weight.\n",

However, the mechanism through which <i>Radix Salviae</i> treats DPN remains unclear. Therefore, we aimed to explore the mechanism of action of <i>Radix Salviae</i> against DPN using network pharmacology. The active ingredients and target genes of <i>Radix Salviae</i> were screened using the TCM pharmacology database and analysis platform. The genes associated with DPN were obtained from the Gene Cards and OMIM databases, a drug-com-position-target-disease network was constructed, and a protein-protein inter-action network was subsequently constructed to screen the main targets. Gene Ontology (GO) functional annotation and pathway enrichment analysis were performed <i>via</i> the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) using Bioconductor. A total of 56 effective components, 108 targets and 4581 DPN-related target genes of <i>Radix Salviae</i> were screened. Intervention with <i>Radix Salviae</i> for DPN mainly involved 81 target genes. The top 30 major targets were selected for enrichment analysis of GO and KEGG pathways. These results suggested that <i>Radix Salviae</i> could treat DPN by regulating the AGE-RAGE signaling pathway and the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. Therefore, Danshen may affect DPN by regulating inflammation and apoptosis.\n",

            "ID: 38766427, Title: Tuberculosis-diabetes comorbidities: Mechanistic insights for clinical considerations and treatment challenges., Abstract: Tuberculosis (TB) remains a leading cause of death among infectious diseases, particularly in poor countries. Viral infections, multidrug-resistant and ex-tensively drug-resistant TB strains, as well as the coexistence of chronic illnesses such as diabetes mellitus (DM) greatly aggravate TB morbidity and mortality. DM [particularly type 2 DM (T2DM)] and TB have converged making their control even more challenging. Two contemporary global epidemics, TB-DM behaves like a syndemic, a synergistic confluence of two highly prevalent diseases. T2DM is a risk factor for developing more severe forms of multi-drug resistant-TB and TB recurrence after preventive treatment. Since a bidirectional relationship exists between TB and DM, it is necessary to concurrently treat both, and promote recommendations for the joint management of both diseases. There are also some drug-drug interactions resulting in adverse treatment outcomes in TB-DM patients including treatment failure, and reinfection. In addition, autophagy may play a role in these comorbidities. Therefore, the TB-DM comorbidities present several health challenges, requiring a focus on multidisciplinary collaboration and integrated strategies, to effectively deal with this double burden. To effectively manage the comorbidity, further screening in affected countries, more suitable drugs, and better treatment strategies are required.\n",
            "ID: 38766425, Title: Cardioprotective effects of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists in heart failure: Myth or truth?, Abstract: Therapy with glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP1) receptor agonists has raised great interest for its beneficial cardiovascular effects in preventing atherosclerosis and heart failure-related outcomes. However, while evidence about atherosclerosis consistently suggests a cardioprotective potential with class effect, controversies remain on its impact on heart failure. GLP1 receptor agonists appear to prevent hospitalization for new-onset heart failure and reduce symptoms in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (as demonstrated by the recent STEP-HFpEF Trial). Still, GLP1 agonism has resulted in neutral or even harmful effects in patients with established heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (the LIVE trial). GLP1 receptor agonists benefit the cardiovascular system indirectly through their marked metabolic effects (improved weight management, glycemic control, blood pressure, systemic and tissue inflammation), while direct effects on the heart have been questioned. Nonetheless, weight loss alone achieved through GLP1 receptor agonists has failed in improving left ventricular functions. Tirzepatide is a dual agonist of GLP1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide, representing an innovative treatment option in diabetes with a major impact on weight loss and promising cardiovascular benefits. Whether this class of therapies is going to change the history of heart failure is an ongoing debate.\n",
            "ID: 38766423, Title: Challenges and pitfalls of youth-onset type 2 diabetes., Abstract: The incidence and prevalence of youth-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are increasing. The rise in frequency and severity of childhood obesity, inclination to sedentary lifestyle, and epigenetic risks related to prenatal hyperglycemia exposure are important drivers of the youth-onset T2DM epidemic and might as well be responsible for the early onset of diabetes complications. Indeed, youth-onset T2DM has a more extreme metabolic phenotype than adult-onset T2DM, with greater insulin resistance and more rapid deterioration of beta cell function. Therefore, intermediate complications such as microalbuminuria develop in late childhood or early adulthood, while end-stage complications develop in mid-life. Due to the lack of efficacy and safety data, several drugs available for the treatment of adults with T2DM have not been approved in youth, reducing the pharmacological treatment options. In this mini review, we will try to address the present challenges and pitfalls related to youth-onset T2DM and summarize the available interventions to mitigate the risk of microvascular and macrovascular complications.\n",

We focus on the epidemiological, pathophysiological, and clinical interplay between obesity and type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Overweight and obesity represent a growing threat for modern societies and people with T1DM could not be an exception to this rule. Chronic exogenous insulin administration, genetic and epigenetic factors, and psy-chosocial and behavioral parameters, along with the modern way of life that incorporates unhealthy eating patterns and physical inactivity, set the stage for the increasing obesity rates in T1DM. As our knowledge of the underlying mechanisms that lead to the development of obesity and hyperglycemia expands, it becomes clear that there are overlap zones in the pathophysiology of the two main types of diabetes. Stereotypes regarding strict dividing lines between \"autoimmune\" and \"metabolic\" phenotypes increase the risk of trapping physicians into ineffective therapeutic approaches, instead of individualized diabetes care. In this context, the use of adjuncts to insulin therapy that have the potential to alleviate cardiorenal risk and decrease body weight can reduce the burden of obesity in patients with T1DM.\n",

Forty-three eyes of 43 patients followed up with orbital mucormycosis infections were included in the study. Demographic characteristics of the patients, symptoms at admission, ophthalmologic and non-ophthalmologic examination findings, clinical findings during follow-up, medical and surgical procedures, and complications were recorded. Patient survival was determined by assessing the incidence of mortality, and vision survival was defined as achieving a final visual acuity of at least light perception. Twenty-seven (62.8%) patients were male, and 16 (37.2%) were female. When the underlying disease status of the patients was examined, it was observed that all patients had an underlying disease and diabetes constituted the majority (65.2%). Periorbital swelling (69.8%) and ophthalmoplegia (53.5%) were the most common symptoms and findings at the admission of patients with mucormycosis infection. The disease resulted in death in 22 (51.2%) patients. The presence of fever and shorter duration of antifungal therapy were associated with lower patient survival. Exenteration surgery was not found to be associated with the survival of the patients. Frozen eye, loss of pupillary light reflex, and development of central retinal artery occlusion were associated with lower vision survival. This study presents one of the most extensive patient series in the literature on rhino-orbital mucormycosis. Knowing the patients' symptoms at the time of admission and the clinical findings during the infection process will increase awareness about the disease.\n",

SGLT2 inhibitors protect patients with T2DM from cardiovascular complications and are generally safe. <b>Aim:</b> The aim of this study is to assess the cardiovascular effects of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with T2DM. <b>Methods:</b> A systematic review was conducted using published English literature in PubMed and Google Scholar databases. <b>Results:</b> Most of the studies showed significant positive cardiovascular effects of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with and without established cardiovascular disease (CVD). Empagliflozin reduced the risk of cardiovascular death, hospitalization for heart failure (HHF), cardiovascular death or heart failure, and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) such as nonfatal stroke, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular death regardless of the number of cardiovascular risk factors. The effects of empagliflozin on cardiovascular events and mortality in patients with coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) were assessed. Further, the efficacy of empagliflozin in three different phenotypic groups, namely, younger patients with shorter duration of T2DM and highest glomerular filtration rate, women without coronary artery disease, and older adults with advanced coronary artery disease plus several comorbidities, was also assessed. The effects of canagliflozin were evaluated in patients with and without a history of CVD and with different body weights, and in those with and without prior heart failure. Treatment with canagliflozin based on multivariable-predicted cardiovascular risk factors prevented heart failure events more than treatment based on glycated hemoglobin and albuminuria alone. The efficacy of dapagliflozin was evaluated in patients with or at risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), heart failure status, and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), as well as the elderly population. A reduction in HHF or cardiovascular death and insignificant reduction in MACE were noted. Furthermore, significant reduction in the risk of cardiovascular death and all-cause mortality in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) was also observed. Sotagliflozin was studied for its cardiovascular outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease with or without albuminuria and resulted in a reduction in cardiovascular-related deaths and HHF. <b>Conclusion:</b> SGLT2 inhibitors have beneficial cardiovascular effects in patients with T2DM and should be incorporated into their management.\n",

Functional and pathway enrichment analyses were conducted to elucidate the involved biological processes (BP) and pathways. Weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) identified modules associated with DKD. LASSO regression and random forest selected NET-related characteristic genes (NRGs) related to DKD tubulointerstitial injury. <b>Results:</b> Eight hundred ninety-eight DEGs were identified from the GSE30122 dataset. A significant module associated with diabetic tubulointerstitial injury overlapped with 15 NRGs. The hub genes, CASP1 and LYZ, were identified as potential biomarkers. Functional enrichment linked these genes with immune cell trafficking, metabolic alterations, and inflammatory responses. NRGs negatively correlated with glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in the Neph v5 database. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) validated increased NRGs in DKD tubulointerstitial injury. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our findings suggest that the CASP1 and LYZ genes may serve as potential diagnostic biomarkers for diabetic tubulointerstitial injury. Furthermore, NRGs involved in diabetic tubulointerstitial injury could emerge as prospective targets for the diagnosis and treatment of DKD.\n",

It has several physiological functions such as blood colloidal osmotic pressure, antioxidant activity, binding and transporting of endogenous and exogenous substrates. We conducted an electronic search across several databases such as PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane, Embase and Science Direct using the relevant MeSH terms and keywords like \"albumin\", \"serum albumin\", \"salivary albumin\", \"oral health\" \"dental caries\" and \"epidemiology\". Only the epidemiological studies published between 2010 and 2023 were included. After the application of the inclusion criteria, a total of 51 studied were included in this narrative review. Serum and salivary albumin tests have been used in various aspects of oral health as a diagnostic and prognostic factor. Some of the results point out to a pattern of association while some of them are inconclusive and even contradictory. This narrative review discusses the role, significance and impact of albumin in epidemiological oral health related studies including the categories of periodontal health and disease, dental caries, oral function and hypofunction, nutrition and malnutrition, tooth loss and its treatment, diabetes and cancer. In addition, it offers a short manual for the researchers on when, where and how to use albumin tests in planning their study designs whether investigating an association or measure them as a covariate.\n",
            "ID: 38766166, Title: Pharmacological inhibition of tyrosine protein-kinase 2 reduces islet inflammation and delays type 1 diabetes onset in mice., Abstract: Tyrosine protein-kinase 2 (TYK2), a member of the Janus kinase family, mediates inflammatory signaling through multiple cytokines, including interferon-α (IFNα), interleukin (IL)-12, and IL-23. Missense mutations in TYK2 are associated with protection against type 1 diabetes (T1D), and inhibition of TYK2 shows promise in the management of other autoimmune conditions. Here, we evaluated the effects of specific TYK2 inhibitors (TYK2is) in pre-clinical models of T1D. First, human β cells, cadaveric donor islets, and iPSC-derived islets were treated <i>in vitro</i> with IFNα in combination with a small molecule TYK2i (BMS-986165 or a related molecule BMS-986202). TYK2 inhibition prevented IFNα-induced β cell HLA class I up-regulation, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and chemokine production. In co-culture studies, pre-treatment of β cells with a TYK2i prevented IFNα-induced activation of T cells targeting an epitope of insulin. <i>In vivo</i> administration of BMS-986202 in two mouse models of T1D ( <i>RIP-LCMV-GP</i> mice and NOD mice) reduced systemic and tissue-localized inflammation, prevented β cell death, and delayed T1D onset. Transcriptional phenotyping of pancreatic islets, pancreatic lymph nodes (PLN), and spleen during early disease pathogenesis highlighted a role for TYK2 inhibition in modulating signaling pathways associated with inflammation, translational control, stress signaling, secretory function, immunity, and diabetes. Additionally, TYK2i treatment changed the composition of innate and adaptive immune cell populations in the blood and disease target tissues, resulting in an immune phenotype with a diminished capacity for β cell destruction. Overall, these findings indicate that TYK2i has beneficial effects in both the immune and endocrine compartments in models of T1D, thus supporting a path forward for testing TYK2 inhibitors in human T1D.\n",

Retrospective cohort study. 1247 glaucoma surgery and treatment naïve eyes of 626 patients who were initiated on GLP-1R agonists compared to 1083 glaucoma surgery and treatment naïve eyes of 547 patients who were initiated on other oral antidiabetics. The University of California Health Data Warehouse was queried for patients exposed to GLP-1R agonists or other oral antidiabetics. Index date was defined as the date of first exposure to the medication. Eyes with at least one pre-exposure and one post-exposure tonometry record within 365 days of the index date were included in the analysis. Clinical and laboratory data elements were extracted from the database. Eyes were censored from the analysis upon exposure to glaucoma hypotensive medication or glaucoma surgery. ΔIOP was analyzed using a paired t-test. Regression analysis was conducted using generalized estimating equations (GEE) accounting for inter-eye correlation. Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the robustness of the findings. Primary outcome measure was ΔIOP after exposure to the medication. The median age of all included subjects was 66.2 years [IQR=18.3]; 607 (51.7%) were female, and 667 (56.9%) were Caucasian. Median pre-exposure IOP, HbA1c, and BMI were 15.2 mmHg [IQR=3.8], 7.5 [IQR=2.4], and 29.8 [IQR=9.4], respectively. 776 individuals (66.1%) had diabetes, with the median number of active oral antidiabetics being 1.0 [IQR=1.0], and 441 (37.5%) being insulin users. Several pre-exposure characteristics significantly differed between the GLP-1R agonist and the control group. The mean ΔIOP was -0.4±2.8 mmHg (paired t-test p<0.001) and -0.2±3.3 mmHg (paired t-test p = 0.297) in the GLP-1R agonist and other antidiabetics groups, respectively. Pre-exposure IOP was the only independent predictor of ΔIOP in multivariable GEE. Sensitivity analyses yielded similar results. Although GLP-1R agonists were significantly associated with a decrease in IOP in the paired analysis, they were not associated with ΔIOP in multivariable GEE. Moreover, the difference between the ΔIOP in the two groups was small. Future prospective studies following a standardized dose and delivery method may provide further insights.\n",

This study was aimed to investigate the causal relationship between metformin and MI using Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. The genome-wide significant (<i>P</i><5×10<sup>-8</sup>) single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in patients with metformin and patients with MI were screened from the Open genome-wide association study (GWAS) project as instrumental variables (IVs). The study outcomes mainly included MI, old MI, acute MI, acute transmural MI of inferior wall, and acute transmural MI of anterior wall. The inverse variance weighted (IVW) method was applied to assess the main causal effect, and weighted median, simple mode, weighted mode methods, and MR-Egger regression were auxiliary applied for supplementary proof. The causal relationship between metformin and MI was assessed using odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). A leave-one-out method was used to explore the effect of individual SNPs on the results of IVW analyses, and a funnel plot was used to analyze the potential bias of the study results, thus ensuring the robustness of the results. In total, 16, 84, 39, 26, and 34 SNPs were selected as IVs to assess the genetic association between metformin and outcomes of MI, old MI, acute MI, acute transmural MI of inferior wall, and acute transmural MI of anterior wall, respectively. Treatment with metformin does not affect the risk of acute transmural MI of anterior wall at the genetic level (<i>P</i>>0.05; OR for inverse variance weighted was 1.010). In the cases of MI, old MI, acute MI, and acute transmural MI of inferior wall, metformin may even be a risk factor for patients (<i>P</i><0.05; ORs for inverse variance weighted were 1.078, 1.026, 1.022 and 1.018 respectively). There was no horizontal pleiotropy or heterogeneity among IVs. The results were stable when removing the SNPs one by one. Metformin is not protective against the risk of myocardial infarction in patients and may even be a risk factor for MI, old MI, acute MI, and acute transmural MI of inferior wall.\n",

It is the severe complications that make this disease more intricate. A diabetic wound is one of these complications. Patients with diabetes are at higher risk of developing diabetic foot ulcers (DFU). Due to the ineffectiveness of Conventional treatments, growth in limb amputation, morbidity, and mortality have been recognized, which indicates the need for additional treatment. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can significantly improve wound healing. However, there are some risks related to stem cell therapy. Exosome therapy is a new treatment option for diabetic wounds that has shown promising results. However, an even more advanced form called cell-free therapy using exosomes has emerged. This upgraded version of stem cell therapy offers improved efficacy and eliminates the risk of cancer progression. Exosome therapy promotes wound healing from multiple angles, unlike traditional methods that primarily rely on the body's self-healing ability and only provide wound protection. Therefore, exosome therapy has the potential to replace conventional treatments effectively. However, further research is necessary to distinguish the optimal type of stem cells for therapy, ensure their safety, establish appropriate dosing, and identify the best management trail. The present study focused on the current literature on diabetic wound ulcers, their treatment, and mesenchymal stem cell and exosome therapy potential in DFU.\n",
            "ID: 38765768, Title: Factors Associated with Patient Education in Patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) - A Primary Health Care Register-Based Study., Abstract: Patient education in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is recommended in treatment strategy documents, since it can improve the ability to cope with the disease. Our aim was to identify the extent of and factors associated with patient education in patients with COPD in a primary health care setting. In this nationwide study, we identified 29,692 COPD patients with a registration in the Swedish National Airway Register (SNAR) in 2019. Data on patient education and other clinical variables of interest were collected from SNAR. The database was linked to additional national registers to obtain data about pharmacological treatment, exacerbations and educational level. Patient education had been received by 44% of COPD patients, 72% of whom had received education on pharmacological treatment including inhalation technique. A higher proportion of patients who had received education were offered smoking cessation support, had performed spirometry and answered the COPD Assessment Test (CAT), compared with patients without patient education. In the adjusted analysis, GOLD grade 2 (OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.18-1.42), grade 3 (OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.27-1.57) and grade 4 (OR 1.79, 95% CI 1.48-2.15), as well as GOLD group E (OR 1.17, 95% CI 1.06-1.29), ex-smoking (OR 1.70, 95% CI 1.56-1.84) and current smoking (OR 1.45, 95% CI 1.33-1.58) were positively associated with having received patient education, while cardiovascular disease (OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.87-0.98) and diabetes (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.87-1.00) were negatively associated with receipt of patient education. Fewer than half of the patients had received patient education, and the education had mostly been given to those with more severe COPD, ex- and current smokers and patients with fewer comorbidities. Our study highlights the need to enhance patient education at an earlier stage of the disease.\n",
            "ID: 38765734, Title: Investigation of risk factors in the development of recurrent urethral stricture after internal urethrotomy., Abstract: Urethral stricture is a condition that often develops with trauma and results in narrowing of the urethral lumen. Although endoscopic methods are mostly used in its treatment, it has high recurrence rates. Therefore, open urethroplasty is recommended after unsuccessful endoscopic treatments. To investigate the risk factors associated with urethral stricture recurrence. The data of male patients who underwent internal urethrotomy for urethral stricture between January 2017 and January 2023 were retrospectively analyzed. Demographic data, comorbidities, preoperative haemogram, and biochemical values obtained from peripheral blood and operative data were recorded. Patients were divided into two groups in terms of recurrence development; recurrence and non-recurrence. Initially recorded data were compared between the two groups. A total of 303 patients were included in the study. The mean age of the patients was 66.6 ± 13.6 years. The mean duration of recurrence development was 9.63 ± 9.84 (min-max: 1-39) months in the recurrence group. Recurrence did not occur in non-recurrence group throughout the follow-up period with an average time of 44.15 ± 24.07 (min-max: 12-84) months. In the comparison of both groups, the presence of diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HT), and multiple comorbidities were significantly higher in the recurrence (+) group (<i>P</i> = 0.038, <i>P</i> = 0.012, <i>P</i> = 0.013). Blood group, postoperative use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, preoperative cystostomy, cause of stricture, iatrogenic cause of stricture, location and length of stricture, indwelling urinary cathater size and day of catheter removal did not differ between the two groups. No statistically significant difference was observed between the two groups in terms of age, uroflowmetric maximum flow rate value, hemogram parameters, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), fasting blood sugar, creatinine, glomerular filtration rate, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, platelet-lymphocyte ratio, lymphocyte-monocyte ratio, monocyte-lymphocyte ratio and AST/ALT ratios. In patients with urethral stricture recurrence, only the frequency of DM and HT was high, while inflammation marker levels and stricture-related parameters were similar between the groups.\n",
            "ID: 38765635, Title: A Comprehensive Review on Weight Gain following Discontinuation of Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor Agonists for Obesity., Abstract: Obesity is considered the leading public health problem in the medical sector. The phenotype includes overweight conditions that lead to several other comorbidities that drastically decrease health. Glucagon-like receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) initially designed for treating type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) had demonstrated weight loss benefits in several clinical trials<i>. In vivo</i> studies showed that GLP-1RA encourages reduced food consumption and consequent weight reduction by stimulating brown fat and enhancing energy outlay through the action of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) pathways. Additionally, GLP-1RAs were found to regulate food intake through stimulation of sensory neurons in the vagus, interaction with the hypothalamus and hindbrain, and through inflammation and intestinal microbiota. However, the main concern with the use of GLP-1RA treatment was weight gain after withdrawal or discontinuation. We could identify three different ways that could lead to weight gain. Potential factors might include temporary hormonal adjustment in response to weight reduction, the central nervous system's (CNS) incompetence in regulating weight augmentation owing to the lack of GLP-1RA, and <i>β</i>-cell malfunction due to sustained exposure to GLP-1RA. Here, we also review the data from clinical studies that reported withdrawal symptoms. Although the use of GLP-1RA could be beneficial in multiple ways, withdrawal after years has the symptoms reversed. Clinical studies should emphasize the downside of these views we highlighted, and mechanistic studies must be carried out for a better outcome with GLP-1RA from the laboratory to the bedside.\n",
            "ID: 38765603, Title: Genetic Diagnosis of Adult Hemodialysis Patients With Unknown Etiology., Abstract: Kidney disease of unknown etiology accounts for 1 in 10 adult end-stage renal disease (ESRD) cases worldwide. The aim of this study is to clarify the genetic background of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) of unknown etiology who initiated renal replacement therapy (RRT) in adulthood. This is a multicenter cross-sectional cohort study. Of the 1164 patients who attended 4 dialysis clinics in Japan, we first selected patients who started RRT between the ages of 20 and 49 years. After excluding patients with apparent causes of CKD (e.g., diabetic nephropathy, polycystic kidney disease (PKD) with family history, patients who underwent renal biopsy), 90 patients with CKD of unknown cause were included. The 298 genes associated with CKD were analyzed using capture-based targeted next-generation sequencing. Of the 90 patients, 10 (11.1%) had pathogenic variants in CKD-causing genes and 17 (18.9%) had variant of unknown significance (VUS). Three patients had <i>PKD1</i> pathogenic variants, and 1 patient had <i>PKD1</i> and <i>COL4A4</i> pathogenic variants. In addition, 2 patients were diagnosed with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) due to <i>C3</i> or <i>CFHR5</i>. One patient each was diagnosed with Alport syndrome due to <i>COL4A4</i> and <i>COL4A3</i> variants<i>,</i> nephronophthisis due to <i>NPHP1</i> variants, Fabry disease due to <i>GLA</i> variants, and autosomal-dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease due to <i>UMOD</i> variants. Genetic diagnoses were not concordant with clinical diagnoses, except for patients with <i>PKD1</i> variant. This largest study on genetic analysis in hemodialysis-dependent adults revealed the presence of undiagnosed inherited kidney diseases.\n",
            "ID: 38765600, Title: Alkaline Phosphatase and Parathyroid Hormone Levels: International Variation and Associations With Clinical Outcomes in the DOPPS., Abstract: Secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) increases the risk of fractures and cardiovascular (CV) disease in patients on hemodialysis (HD). The relationship between parathyroid hormone (PTH) and outcomes has been inconsistent, possibly due to variable bone responsiveness to PTH. The KDIGO guideline suggests monitoring total alkaline phosphatase (ALP), but the role of ALP versus PTH in the management of mineral and bone disorder (MBD) is not clear. The analysis included 28,888 patients on HD in 9 countries in Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study (DOPPS) phase 3 to 7 (2005-2021). The primary exposures of interest were normalized ALP and PTH, which are raw values divided by facility upper normal limit, measured at study enrollment. Cox models were used to estimate hazard ratios of all-cause or CV mortality and any or hip fracture adjusted for potential confounders. Linear mixed models, adjusted for potential confounders, were employed to investigate the relationship between normalized ALP levels and patient characteristics. Normalized PTH showed a J-shaped association with all-cause or CV mortality, and a weak linear association with fracture. In contrast, normalized ALP showed a strong association with all outcomes. Factors associated with higher ALP levels after controlling for PTH included Black race, longer dialysis vintage, diabetes mellitus, hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), and the use of cinacalcet. Total ALP is a more robust exposure of adverse outcomes than PTH in patients on HD. PTH responsiveness is affected by race, primary renal disease, comorbidities, and mineral metabolism and therapy. Our results indicate that it may be useful to evaluate target organ response, rather than PTH alone when considering the consequences of (SHPT).\n",
            "ID: 38765561, Title: Calciphylaxis Episodes in the Australia and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant Registry., Abstract: Calciphylaxis is a rare disorder associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Data registries are an invaluable source of information for rare diseases. We reviewed cases of calciphylaxis recorded in the Australia and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant Registry (ANZDATA) and evaluated associations and outcomes of this condition. Data was obtained on all cases of calciphylaxis reported between 2019 and 2022 in Australian and New Zealand patients on kidney replacement therapy (KRT). This cohort was compared to all patients in the registry who received KRT from 2019 to 2022 without an episode of calciphylaxis. Cox proportional hazards regression including a time-varying covariate for calciphylaxis episode was conducted for mortality with models restricted to patients on dialysis only. From 2019 to 2022, 333 patients had calciphylaxis episodes reported. Overall incidence rate for patients on dialysis was 4.5 (4.1-5.1) episodes per 1000 patient-years on dialysis. Median age was 63 (interquartile range [IQR]: 55-73) years, 54% were female, 66% had diabetes, 59% were obese (body mass index [BMI] ≥ 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and 77% were receiving hemodialysis (HD) treatment. Compared to patients without calciphylaxis (<i>n</i> = 46,526), patients with calciphylaxis were more likely to be older, female, and have diabetes, greater BMI, coronary artery, and peripheral vascular disease. The median time to calciphylaxis was 3.2 (IQR: 0.9-6.7) years after KRT commencement. Half of the patients with calciphylaxis died by 12 months from diagnosis. Adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of mortality for patients on dialysis with calciphylaxis <1 year and 1 to 4 years after an episode was 5.8 (4.9-6.9) and 1.5 (1.0-2.1), respectively compared to patients on dialysis without calciphylaxis. Calciphylaxis is a rare but life-threatening condition in people on KRT with the greatest mortality burden within 12 months of diagnosis.\n",
            "ID: 38765471, Title: Estimated Pulse Wave Velocity as a Novel Non-Invasive Biomarker for Metabolic Syndrome Among People Living with HIV., Abstract: This study aims to investigate the relationship between estimated pulse wave velocity (ePWV) and metabolic syndrome (MetS) in people living with HIV (PLWH), proposing a novel and convenient predictor for early detection of MetS in PLWH. A total of 485 PLWH were enrolled. These participants were categorized into two groups based on the estimated pulse wave velocity (ePWV) level. Demographic and clinical data were collected to investigate the correlation between ePWV and MetS. The cohort of 485 PLWH was categorized into high-ePWV and low-ePWV groups based on ePWV cutoff value of 10 m/s. We observed significant differences in components of MetS including triglycerides (TG, P < 0.05), HDL cholesterol (HDL-C, P < 0.01), systolic blood pressure (SBP, P < 0.001), diastolic blood pressure (DBP, P < 0.05), and fasting plasma glucose (FPG, P < 0.001) between the two groups. Furthermore, we employed receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves to demonstrate the effectiveness of ePWV as a predictive indicator for MetS in PLWH (AUC = 0.739, P < 0.001). According to the ROC curve, the optimal cut-off value of ePWV was 7.4 m/s, and its sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing MetS in PLWH were 79.03% and 64.07%, respectively. Although the 7.4 m/s cutoff increased the false positive rate compared to the traditional cutoff, it significantly reduced the rate of missed diagnoses, effectively identifying 79.03% of PLWH with MetS. ePWV is a non-invasive and convenient novel biomarker with predictive capabilities for MetS in PLWH.\n",

            "ID: 38765466, Title: Racial inequities and rare <i>CFTR</i> variants: Impact on cystic fibrosis diagnosis and treatment., Abstract: Cystic fibrosis (CF) has been traditionally viewed as a disease that affects White individuals. However, CF occurs among all races, ethnicities, and geographic ancestries. The disorder results from mutations in the <i>CF transmembrane conductance regulator</i> (<i>CFTR</i>). Varying incidence of CF is reported among Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC), who typically exhibit worse clinical outcomes. These populations are more likely to carry rare <i>CFTR</i> variants omitted from newborn screening panels, leading to disparities in care such as delayed diagnosis and treatment. In this study, we present a case-in-point describing an individual of Gambian descent identified with CF. Patient genotype includes a premature termination codon (PTC) (c.2353C>T) and previously undescribed single nucleotide deletion (c.1970delG), arguing against effectiveness of currently available CFTR modulator-based interventions. Strategies for overcoming these two variants will likely include combinations of PTC suppressors, nonsense mediated decay inhibitors, and/or alternative approaches (e.g. gene therapy). Investigations such as the present study establish a foundation from which therapeutic treatments may be developed. Importantly, c.2353C>T and c.1970delG were not detected in the patient by traditional <i>CFTR</i> screening panels, which include an implicit racial and ethnic diagnostic bias as these tests are comprised of mutations largely observed in people of European ancestry. We suggest that next-generation sequencing of <i>CFTR</i> should be utilized to confirm or exclude a CF diagnosis, in order to equitably serve BIPOC individuals. Additional epidemiologic data, basic science investigations, and translational work are imperative for improving understanding of disease prevalence and progression, <i>CFTR</i> variant frequency, genotype-phenotype correlation, pharmacologic responsiveness, and personalized medicine approaches for patients with African ancestry and other historically understudied geographic lineages.\n",
            "ID: 38765429, Title: Interplay Between Diabetes Mellitus and the Occurrence of Osteoarthritis and Associated Conditions in Women of Menopausal Age., Abstract: Osteoarthritis (OA) and diabetes mellitus (DM) have long-term deleterious chronic effects and are among the most prevalent chronic disorders. DM and its associated factors, such as hyperglycemia, have a significant contribution to the pathophysiology of OA, particularly in post-menopausal women. Women who have uncontrolled diabetes (DM) are more prone to develop osteoarthritis (OA), which may be exacerbated by poor glycemic control. Furthermore, this category of female patients with DM has an increased risk of developing fractures, even in those with initially normal bone density scores, further illustrating the correlation between DM and bone health. Additionally, multiple risk factors, including obesity, metabolic syndrome, hypertension, estrogen-based hormone therapy, and hyperuricemia, in menopausal women can lead to the development and exacerbation of OA. It is discovered that these variables have a direct or indirect impact, frequently causing inflammation and hormonal changes, which contribute to the intricate interaction between DM and OA. The management of OA and DM in women thus calls for a multi-faceted management plan including glycemic control, weight control, exercise, and specialized pain management methods catering to the specific requirements of the patients. Regularly screening for OA should be implemented for menopausal women with DM and utmost care should be provided by healthcare professionals. Regular monitoring of joint health and early management, encouraging interdisciplinary cooperation, putting preventative measures into place, and creating individualized treatment programs are essential. A thorough understanding of the link between DM and OA will ultimately lead to improved health outcomes and a better future for these individuals.\n",
            "ID: 38765423, Title: Assessment of the Level of Knowledge About Risk Factors, Prevention, and Treatment of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus in a Community Sample From Saudi Arabia., Abstract: Introduction Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a common disease affecting pregnant females, and it carries a major risk of short and long-term health problems for both mothers and their offspring. Multiple factors like advanced maternal age, obesity, and unhealthy lifestyle can increase the risk of GDM. The current guidelines recommend screening all pregnant females for risk factors during the first trimester with subsequent testing of the blood glucose level at 24 weeks gestation. Lack of awareness about GDM is a main contributing factor in the delay in screening and diagnosis of GDM with subsequent fetal and maternal complications. This study aims to identify the level of knowledge about GDM among the adult population in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). Material and methods A descriptive cross-sectional questionnaire-based study was conducted to identify the level of knowledge about risk factors, prevention, and treatment of GDM in a community sample from Saudi Arabia. A self-administered electronic questionnaire was designed, tested for validity and reliability, and distributed through social media platforms. It consisted of 18 questions asking about the socio-demographic characteristics, the type of hospital in which the participant receives their medical care, whether the participant heard about GDM or not, and if they know someone with GDM, in addition to questions to assess the level of knowledge about risk factors, complications, prevention, and treatment of GDM. The total score of knowledge was calculated. The multivariate regression analysis test was employed to analyze the relationship between various demographic variables and the level of knowledge about GDM among the study population. A p-value of 0.05 or less was considered statistically significant. Results A total of 539 (100%) participants completed the questionnaire: 263 (48.8%) of them were in the age category (18-25 years), 440 (81.6%) of them were females, 307 (57%) had a bachelor's degree, 275 (51%) were single, 454 (84.2%) had heard about GDM, and 258 (47.9%) of them have or know someone with GDM. The total score of knowledge revealed excellent, good, fair, and poor levels among 334 (62%), 140 (26%), 49 (9%), and 16 (3%) of participants, respectively. The multivariable linear regression model revealed that participants who received health care from governmental hospitals heard about GDM and had or knew someone with GDM were positively associated with a higher level of knowledge. Conclusions The findings revealed that among participants, 62% showed excellent knowledge about GDM, although, the other 38% had non-optimal levels of knowledge. Awareness campaigns are recommended to improve the level of knowledge about this disease, its risk factors, treatment, and complications.\n",
            "ID: 38765344, Title: A Study to Evaluate the Effect of Sodium-Glucose Co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) Inhibitors on Oxidative Stress Parameters in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients., Abstract: Introduction Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a global health issue with 50 million diabetics currently residing in India. Hyperglycemia causes tissue damage due to mitochondrial overproduction of reactive oxygen species. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors (SGLT2i) have shown a decrease in oxidative stress by either amelioration of free-radical generation or potentiation of cellular antioxidative capacity in preclinical studies. However, there is a paucity of published clinical studies. Hence, this study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of co-administration of SGLT2i with other drugs on oxidative stress in type 2 DM (T2DM) patients. Methods A prospective, parallel, open-label study in T2DM patients attending endocrinology OPD was conducted for a period of 12 months. At the clinician's discretion, patients were grouped as SGLT2i as an add-on to standard drugs vs standard drugs alone. Blood samples were collected at baseline and at the end of 12 weeks to estimate malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO), and glutathione (GSH) levels. Secondary parameters - glycemic indices and lipid profile - were estimated every four weeks. Results A total of 32 patients were enrolled in the study (16 per group). There was a significant decrease in MDA (p < 0.05) and NO (p < 0.01) and a highly significant increase in GSH (p < 0.001) at 12 weeks from baseline in the SGLT2i group. A reduction in fasting blood sugar (FBS) and post-prandial blood sugar (PPBS) and a 0.56% difference in HbA1c were also noted in the SGLT2i group. Significant lowering of low-density lipoprotein (LDL, p < 0.05) and elevation in HDL levels (p < 0.05) from baseline was seen in the SGLT2i group.  Conclusion Co-administration of SGLT2i with antidiabetic drugs demonstrated a significant effect in improving oxidative stress biomarkers and glycemic and lipid profiles among T2DM patients.\n",
            "ID: 38765207, Title: Exploring the Impact of Iron Deficiency Anaemia on Glycated Haemoglobin A1c Levels in Pregnant and Non-Pregnant Women: A Systematic Review., Abstract: Haemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) is fundamental in monitoring glycaemic control during pregnancy. However, several conditions could affect this test's accuracy, including iron deficiency anaemia (IDA). Hence, this systematic review delves into the underexplored connection between IDA, iron replacement therapy (IRT), and haemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) during pregnancy. An electronic search of the Cochrane, MEDLINE, and Embase databases was conducted by six authors. From a comprehensive search strategy, 968 records were obtained. After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, seven studies were included, comprising 365 women selected for analysis. Six studies indicated a positive correlation between IDA and HbA1c levels, while one found no correlation. The average HbA1c level of the included studies in pregnant women was 5.64%. In comparison, it was found that non-pregnant women had lower HbA1c levels. Among the included studies, the mean HbA1c levels decreased from 5.1% to 4.89% after treating pregnant women with IRT. The review emphasises the complexity of interpreting HbA1c levels in pregnant women with IDA, highlighting the influence of pregnancy-induced physiological changes. In addition, this suggests that HbA1c should not be the sole criterion for diabetes management in pregnant women with IDA. Future research should focus on alternative glycaemic monitoring methods unaffected by IDA.\n",

Motor nerve conduction velocity (CV) slowing in diabetic DSP exceeds expectations for pure axonal loss thus implicating superimposed acquired demyelination. After establishing demyelination confidence intervals by regression analysis of nerve conduction data from chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), we prospectively studied CV slowing in 90 diabetic DSP patients with and without at least one motor nerve exhibiting CV slowing (groups A and B) into the demyelination range by American Academy of Neurology (AAN) criteria respectively and 95 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients. Simultaneously, secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) activity was assessed in both diabetic groups and 46 healthy controls. No ALS patient exhibited CV slowing in more than two motor nerves based on AAN criteria or the confidence intervals. Group A demonstrated a significantly higher percentage of patients as compared to group B fulfilling the above criteria, with an additional criterion of at least one motor nerve exhibiting CV slowing in the demyelinating range and a corresponding F response in the demyelinating range by AAN criteria (70.3 % <i>vs.</i> 1.9 %; p < 0.0001). Urine sPLA2 activity was increased significantly in diabetic groups as compared to healthy controls (942.9 ± 978.0 <i>vs.</i> 591.6 ± 390.2 pmol/min/ml, p < 0.05), and in group A compared to Group B (1328.3 ± 1274.2 <i>vs.</i> 673.8 ± 576.9 pmol/min/ml, p < 0.01). More patients with elevated sPLA2 activity and more than 2 motor nerves with CV slowing in the AAN or the confidence intervals were identified in group A as compared to group B (35.1 % <i>vs.</i> 5.7 %, p < 0.001). Furthermore, 13.5 % of patients in diabetic DSP Group A, and no patients in diabetic DSP Group B, fulfilled an additional criterion of more than one motor nerve with CV slowing into the demyelinating range with its corresponding F response into the demyelinating range by AAN criteria. A combination of regression analysis of electrodiagnostic data and a urine biological marker of systemic inflammation identifies a subgroup of diabetic DSP with superimposed acquired demyelination that may respond favorably to immunomodulatory therapy.\n",
            "ID: 38765055, Title: Towards Integrated Care for the Elderly: Exploring the Acceptability of Telemonitoring for Hypertension and Type 2 Diabetes Management., Abstract: Telemonitoring has been proposed as an effective method to support integrated care for older people with hypertension and type 2 diabetes. This paper examines acceptability of telemontioring, its role in supporting integrated care, and identifies scale-up barriers. A concurrent triangulation mixed-methods study, including in-depth interviews (n = 29) and quantitative acceptability tool (n = 55) was conducted among individuals who underwent a 12-month telemonitoring routine. The research was guided by the Theoretical Framework of Acceptability. Interviews were analysed using template content analysis (TCA). TCA identified seven domains of acceptability, with twenty-one subthemes influencing it positively or negatively. In the quantitative survey, acceptability was high across all seven domains with an overall score of 4.4 out of 5. Urban regions showed higher acceptability than rural regions (4.5 vs. 4.3), with rural participants perceiving initial training and participation effort as significantly more burdensome than their urban counterparts. Patients described several instances where telemonitoring supported self-management, education, treatment, and identification elements of the integrated care package. However, there were barriers that may limit its further scale-up. For further scale-up, it is important to screen patients for monitoring eligibility, adapt telemonitoring devices to elderly needs, combine telemonitoring with health education, involve family members, and establish follow-up programmes.\n",

Synovial inflammation and synovial pannus are crucial in the onset of RA. The \"tumor-like\" invading proliferation of new arteries is a keynote of RA. Commiphora wightii (<i>C wightii</i>) is a perennial, deciduous, and trifoliate plant used in several areas of southeast Asia to cure numerous ailments, including arthritis, diabetes, obesity, and asthma. Several <i>in vitro</i> investigations have indicated <i>C wightii's</i> therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of arthritis. However, the precise molecular action is yet unknown. In this study, a network pharmacology approach was applied to uncover potential targets, active therapeutic ingredients and signaling pathways in <i>C wightii</i> for the treatment of arthritis. In the groundwork of this research, we examined the active constituent-compound-target-pathway network and evaluated that (Guggulsterol-V, Myrrhahnone B, and Campesterol) decisively donated to the development of arthritis by affecting tumor necrosis factor (TNF), PIK3CA, and MAPK3 genes. Later on, docking was employed to confirm the active components' efficiency against the potential targets. According to molecular-docking research, several potential targets of RA bind tightly with the corresponding key active ingredient of <i>C wightii.</i> With the aid of network pharmacology techniques, we conclude that the signaling pathways and biological processes involved in <i>C wightii</i> had an impact on the prevention of arthritis. The outcomes of molecular docking also serve as strong recommendations for future research. In the context of this study, network pharmacology combined with molecular docking analysis showed that <i>C wightii</i> acted on arthritis-related signaling pathways to exhibit a promising preventive impact on arthritis. These results serve as the basis for grasping the mechanism of the antiarthritis activity of <i>C wightii</i>. However, further <i>in vivo</i>/<i>in vitro</i> study is needed to verify the reliability of these targets for the treatment of arthritis.\n",

Although an anion gap (AG) ≤12 mEq/L is recommended before transition to SQ insulin, there are limited data to support this threshold. <b>Objective:</b> To compare the rates of successful transitions to SQ insulin in patients with DKA with an AG ≤ 12 mEq/L versus > 12 mEq/L. <b>Methods:</b> Retrospective cohort study of adult critically ill patients with moderate to severe DKA between September 2019 and December 2022. The primary outcome was the success of insulin transition between patients transitioned with an AG ≤ 12 mEq/L and those transitioned with an AG > 12 mEq/L. Transition was considered successful if the AG did not increase above the value at transition at 24 hours and insulin infusion was not restarted. Secondary outcomes include the individual components of the primary outcome and ICU length of stay (LOS); safety outcomes included hypoglycemia and electrolyte derangements. <b>Results:</b> In total, 92 patients were included, with 43 patients transitioned at AG ≤ 12 mEq/L and 49 patients transitioned at AG > 12 mEq/L. Transition was unsuccessful in 3 patients (7%) with AG ≤ 12 mEq/L and 2 patients (4%) with AG > 12 mEq/L (<i>P</i> = .66). There was no difference in the incidence of the individual components of this outcome between groups or in safety outcomes. <b>Conclusion:</b> This retrospective study showed no difference in success of insulin transition between the groups. Larger studies are needed to evaluate the impact of treatment characteristics on transition success and patient outcomes.\n",
            "ID: 38764912, Title: Role of follow-up gallium scintigraphy in the evaluation of malignant external otitis (skull base osteomyelitis): A case report., Abstract: Malignant otitis externa (skull base osteomyelitis) can be fatal and long-term antibiotic therapy is recommended. Despite being potentially fatal, this infection causes minor changes in inflammatory biomarkers (white blood cell count and C-reactive protein levels) upon blood testing. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging changes persist over a long period. Therefore, it is difficult to determine the optimal time for the discontinuation of antibiotics. We present a 77-year-old male whose medical history included type 2 diabetes mellitus who suffered from chronic otitis media with Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. His condition did not improve with proper treatment, and imaging revealed malignant otitis media. Intravenous cefepime treatment was administered. Antibiotic treatment was de-escalated to oral levofloxacin treatment after Gallium-67 scintigraphy showed less accumulation after 6 weeks of Cefepime administration; accumulation almost disappeared after 1 year. In this report, we describe the usefulness of gallium scintigraphy in the evaluation of malignant otitis externa.\n",
            "ID: 38764707, Title: Cemiplimab-Induced Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic State With Concurrent Diabetic Ketoacidosis in a Patient Receiving Treatment for Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma., Abstract: The immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) cemiplimab is a human monoclonal antibody used in the treatment of locally advanced and metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) not amenable to surgery or radiation therapy. Although cemiplimab shows excellent efficacy with a good tolerability profile, it can cause side effects, including potentially life-threatening endocrinopathies. We discuss the case of a 77-year-old Caucasian female with CSCC treated with only three cycles of cemiplimab who presented with altered mental status and was found to have severe hyperglycemia, hyperosmolarity, ketonemia, glucosuria, and ketonuria concerning for hyperosmolar hyperglycemic syndrome (HHS) with concurrent diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The patient made a rapid recovery in the hospital while on standard therapies for HHS/DKA and cemiplimab was discontinued upon discharge. While there have been reports of cemiplimab-induced DKA, to our knowledge, this is the first reported case of cemiplimab-induced HHS-DKA. This report aims to shed light on cemiplimab-induced HHS-DKA and to underscore the need to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying ICI-induced diabetes mellitus (ICI-DM).\n",
            "ID: 38764667, Title: Novel Insights in the Hypertension Treatment & Type 2 Diabetics Induced by Angiotensin Receptor Blockers: MD Simulation Studies & Molecular Docking of Some Promising Natural Therapies., Abstract: Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are commonly used to treat hypertension that target the hormonal system (renin-angiotensin system (RAS)), which regulates various physiological functions in the body. ARBs work by blocking the binding of angiotensin II to its receptor, thereby preventing a rise in blood pressure. These drugs not only normalize the overactivation of RAS but also provide protective effects against cardiovascular, renal, and type 2 diabetic patients. Inappropriate RAS activity has been linked to insulin resistance of type 2 diabetes. Olmesartan, as an ARB, was found to have a beneficial role in reducing postprandial glucose levels in type 2 diabetes. However, ARBs can cause side effects, prompting a search for new compounds that have fewer adverse effects. This study explores the potential of natural metabolites, specifically eugenol, gallic acid, myricetin, <i>p</i>-cymene, quercetin, and kaempferol, as ARB inhibitors compared to the current standard, olmesartan. Using in silico studies, the binding affinity of these natural substances to the ARB receptor was evaluated. The results showed that myricetin and kaempferol had affinities higher than those of olmesartan, suggesting that they could serve as promising ARB inhibitors for hypertension treatment. These natural compounds could provide an alternative approach to conventional antihypertensive drugs, which may have fewer side effects. However, more research is needed to validate the efficacy and safety of these natural compounds as antihypertensive drugs. Further in vitro and in vivo studies are needed to confirm their effectiveness and safety. This study provides a promising starting point for future investigations into the potential of natural metabolites as alternative treatments for hypertension. The findings also highlight the importance of exploring natural alternative treatments for hypertension and the protective effects of ARBs on early stage type-2 diabetics.\n",
            "ID: 38764602, Title: Mind the Gap in Kidney Care: Translating What We Know Into What We do., Abstract: Historically, it takes an average of 17 years to move new treatments from clinical evidence to daily practice. Given the highly effective treatments now available to prevent or delay kidney disease onset and progression, this is far too long. The time is now to narrow the gap between what we know and what we do. Clear guidelines exist for the prevention and management of common risk factors for kidney disease, such as hypertension and diabetes, but only a fraction of people with these conditions worldwide are diagnosed, and even fewer are treated to target. Similarly, the vast majority of people living with kidney disease are unaware of their condition, because in the early stages, it is often silent. Even among patients who have been diagnosed, many do not receive appropriate treatment for kidney disease. Considering the serious consequences of kidney disease progression, kidney failure, or death, it is imperative that treatments are initiated early and appropriately. Opportunities to diagnose and treat kidney disease early must be maximized beginning at the primary-care level. Many systematic barriers exist, ranging from patient to clinician to health systems to societal factors. To preserve and improve kidney health for everyone everywhere, each of these barriers must be acknowledged so that sustainable solutions are developed and implemented without further delay.\n",
            "ID: 38764445, Title: Real-world non-interventional post-authorization safety study of long-term use of burosumab in children and adolescents with X-linked hypophosphatemia: first interim analysis., Abstract: X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH) is a rare, progressive disorder characterized by excess fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), causing renal phosphate-wasting and impaired active vitamin D synthesis. Burosumab is a recombinant human monoclonal antibody that inhibits FGF23, restoring patient serum phosphate levels. Safety data on long-term burosumab treatment are currently limited. This post-authorization safety study (PASS) aims to monitor long-term safety outcomes in children and adolescents (1-17 years) treated with burosumab for XLH. This first interim analysis reports the initial PASS safety outcomes. A 10-year retrospective and prospective cohort study. This PASS utilizes International XLH Registry (NCT03193476) data, which includes standard diagnostic and monitoring practice data at participating European centers. At data cut-off (13 May 2021), 647 participants were included in the International XLH Registry; 367 were receiving burosumab, of which 67 provided consent to be included in the PASS. Mean (SD) follow-up time was 2.2 (1.0) years. Mean (SD) age was 7.3 (4.3) years (range 1.0-17.5 years). Mean duration of burosumab exposure was 29.7 (25.0) months. Overall, 25/67 participants (37.3%) experienced ⩾1 adverse event (AE) during follow-up; 83 AEs were reported. There were no deaths, no AEs leading to treatment withdrawal, nor serious AEs related to treatment. The most frequently reported AEs were classified as 'musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders', with 'pain in extremity' most frequently reported, followed by 'infections and infestations', with 'tooth abscess' the most frequently reported. In this first interim analysis of the PASS, covering the initial 2 years of data collection, the safety profile of burosumab is consistent with previously reported safety data. The PASS will provide long-term safety data over its 10-year duration for healthcare providers and participants with XLH that contribute to improvements in the knowledge of burosumab safety.

            "ID: 38764377, Title: Effects of high-intensity statin therapy on steroid hormones and vitamin D in type 2 diabetic men: A prospective self-controlled study., Abstract: The study aimed to assess the effect of high-intensity statin therapy on testicular and adrenal steroids and vitamin D levels in type 2 diabetic men. A prospective study, conducted between March 2021 and July 2022, including 60 men with type 2 diabetes, aged 40-65 years, statin-free, and in whom treatment with high-intensity statin was indicated. The patients had two visits, before and 6 months after a daily intake of 40 mg of atorvastatin. During each visit, they underwent a clinical examination, and a fasting blood sample was collected for biological and hormonal measurements. There was a significant increase in the prevalence of decreased libido (from 22% to 47%, p = 0.001) and a significant decrease in the frequency of sexual intercourse (from 4 [1-8] to 3 [0-4] per month, p = 0.005). The median ADAM's score significantly increased (from 4 [2-7] to 6 [3-8], p = 0.000). Twenty-two percent of the patients developed gynecomastia. The median total, bioavailable and free testosterone significantly decreased from 15.1 (11.4-17.4), 6.3 (5.0-7.8), and 0.27 (0.22-0.33) nmol/L to 12.7 (10.7-15.9), 5.7 (4.4-7.0), and 0.24 (0.19-0.30) nmol/L, respectively, with no change in FSH and LH levels. Three patients (5%) developed hypogonadism (testosterone <8 nmol/L). There was a significant decrease in DHEAS from 4.5 (2.8-6.1) to 3.8 μmol/L (2.6-5.6) and no change in cortisol and vitamin D levels. High-intensity statin therapy decreased androgen levels in type 2 diabetic men with significant clinical impact.\n",
            "ID: 38764356, Title: Effect of preceding drug therapy on the renal and cardiovascular outcomes of combined sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease., Abstract: To conduct a post hoc subgroup analysis of patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) from the RECAP study, who were treated with sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) combination therapy, focusing only on those patients who had chronic kidney disease (CKD), to examine whether the composite renal outcome differed between those who received SGLT2 inhibitor treatment first and those who received a GLP-1RA first. We included 438 patients with CKD (GLP-1RA-first group, n = 223; SGLT2 inhibitor-first group, n = 215) from the 643 T2D patients in the RECAP study. The incidence of the composite renal outcome, defined as progression to macroalbuminuria and/or a ≥50% decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), was analysed using a propensity score (PS)-matched model. Furthermore, we calculated the win ratio for these composite renal outcomes, which were weighted in the following order: (1) both a ≥50% decrease in eGFR and progression to macroalbuminuria; (2) a decrease in eGFR of ≥50% only; and (3) progression to macroalbuminuria only. Using the PS-matched model, 132 patients from each group were paired. The incidence of renal composite outcomes did not differ between the two groups (GLP-1RA-first group, 10%; SGLT2 inhibitor-first group, 17%; odds ratio 1.80; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.85 to 4.26; p = 0.12). The win ratio of the GLP-1RA-first group versus the SGLT2 inhibitor-first group was 1.83 (95% CI 1.71 to 1.95; p < 0.001). Although the renal composite outcome did not differ between the two groups, the win ratio of the GLP-1RA-first group versus the SGLT2 inhibitor-first group was significant. These results suggest that, in GLP-1RA and SGLT2 inhibitor combination therapy, the addition of an SGLT2 inhibitor to baseline GLP-1RA treatment may lead to more favourable renal outcomes.\n",
            "ID: 38764311, Title: Transcriptomics reveals transient and dynamic muscle fibrosis and atrophy differences following spinal cord injury in rats., Abstract: The rate and magnitude of skeletal muscle wasting after severe spinal cord injury (SCI) exceeds most other disuse conditions. Assessing the time course of molecular changes can provide insight into the progression of muscle wasting post-SCI. The goals of this study were (1) to identify potential targets that may prevent the pathologic features of SCI in soleus muscles and (2) to establish therapeutic windows for treating these pathologic changes. Four-month-old Sprague-Dawley male rats received T9 laminectomy (SHAM surgery) or severe contusion SCI. Hindlimb locomotor function was assessed weekly, with soleus muscles obtained 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month and 3 months post-surgery (n = 6-7 per group per timepoint). RNA was extracted from muscles for bulk RNA-sequencing analysis (n = 3-5 per group per timepoint). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were evaluated between age-matched SHAM and SCI animals. Myofiber size, muscle fibre type and fibrosis were assessed on contralateral muscles. SCI produced immediate and persistent hindlimb paralysis, with Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan locomotor scores remaining below 7 throughout the study, contributing to a progressive 25-50% lower soleus mass and myofiber atrophy versus SHAM (P < 0.05 at all timepoints). Transcriptional comparisons of SCI versus SHAM resulted in 184 DEGs (1 week), 436 DEGs (2 weeks), 133 DEGs (1 month) and 1200 DEGs (3 months). Upregulated atrophy-related genes included those associated with cell senescence, nuclear factor kappa B, ubiquitin proteasome and unfolded protein response pathways, along with upregulated genes that negatively influence muscle growth through the transforming growth factor beta pathway and inhibition of insulin-like growth factor-I/Akt/mechanistic target of rapamycin and p38/mitogen-activated protein kinase signalling. Genes associated with extracellular matrix (ECM), including collagens, collagen crosslinkers, proteoglycans and those regulating ECM integrity, were enriched within upregulated DEGs at 1 week but subsequently downregulated at 2 weeks and 3 months and were accompanied by >50% higher ECM areas and hydroxyproline levels in SCI muscles (P < 0.05). Myofiber remodelling genes were enriched in upregulated DEGs at 2 weeks and 1 month and were downregulated at 3 months. Genes that regulate neuromuscular junction remodelling were evident in muscles post-SCI, along with slow-to-fast fibre-type shifts: 1 week and 2 weeks SCI muscles were composed of 90% myosin heavy chain (MHC) type I fibres, which decreased to only 16% at 3 months and were accompanied by 50% fibres containing MHC IIX (P < 0.05). Metabolism genes were enriched in upregulated DEGs at 1 month and were further enriched at 3 months. Our results substantiate many known pathologic features of SCI-induced wasting in rat skeletal muscle and identify a progressive and dynamic transcriptional landscape within the post-SCI soleus. Future studies are warranted to consider these therapeutic treatment windows when countering SCI muscle pathology.\n",
            "ID: 38764270, Title: Comparison of clinical and microbiological characteristics of community-acquired hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae liver abscess in diabetic and non-diabetic patients., Abstract: Invasive infection caused by hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae (HvKP) has been reported worldwide. Most of the patients are community population, related to diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic liver disease and other basic diseases, which prone to systemic migratory infection. In this study, we collected 377 patients with community acquired Klebsiella pneumoniae liver abscess in our hospital from January 2013 to December 2018, 65.8% of whom were male, and 49.6% had DM. Patients with DM are prone to eye and central nervous system (CNS) infection, which need continuous local abscess drainage during treatment. Among them, patients with poor blood glucose control have a higher rate of blood stream infections (BSI). 219 strains of HvKP were obtained, with K1/K2 Serotype accounted for 81.7%. The incidence of BSI in K2 patients was higher than that in K1 patients. The PCR results indicate that the carrying rate of virulence genes (rmpA、areo、kfu、allS、iroN、magA、uge、wcaG) in K1/K2 type strains is significantly higher than that in non K1/K2 type strains. ST23 and ST65 are the most common multilocus sequence typing (MLST), which belong to K1 and K2 Serotype respectively. All of HvKP strains showed high sensitivity to commonly used clinical antibiotics other than ampicillin, with 54.3% of the strains exhibiting high viscosity characteristics. Meanwhile, 35 classic Klebsiella pneumoniae (cKP) strains were collected, and their serum typing is mainly non K1/K2. The carrying rate of virulence genes and viscosity degree in HvKP are significantly higher than those in cKP. Primary liver abscess caused by HvKP is prone to multiple tissue and organ infections, but it shows higher sensitivity to most commonly used antibiotics in clinical practice except for ampicillin. After effective treatment, the overall prognosis of patients is better. This study analyzes the pathogenic characteristics of HvKP and elaborates on the clinical characteristics of patients, which can provide reference for clinical and scientific research work.\n",
            "ID: 38764169, Title: Biosynthesis, characterization, and anticoagulant properties of copper nanoparticles from red seaweed of Acanthophora sp., Abstract: In the last few decades, nanoparticles have found extensive use in a variety of biological applications. Traditional medicine widely uses Acanthophora sp., a marine macroalgae, to cure and prevent diabetes, skin disorders, and blood clotting. The present study aims to investigate whether green-synthesized copper nanoparticles (CuNPs) might work as an anticoagulant. The CuNPs were made using an environmentally friendly method that uses Acanthophora extract. We used UV-vis spectroscopy to assess the surface plasmon resonance of the material, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to analyze its form, and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy to identify the material's constituent elements. Furthermore, Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) determined the functional groups of the CuNPs. The biosynthesis of CuNPs was confirmed by UV-vis spectroscopy, which showed a surface plasmon resonance peak at 570 nm. The FT-IR analysis showed that certain functional groups are involved in the formation of CuNPs. These groups include OH stretching, C=O stretching, C-H bonding, C-N bonding, and Cu vibration. SEM analysis demonstrated the morphology of CuNPs synthesized, with a size of 0.5 μm, while EDS analysis confirmed their purity. The anticoagulant activity of prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) assays showed that the clotting time got longer depending on the concentration. The CuNPs synthesized from Acanthophora had strong anticoagulant effects at 100 μg/mL, further suggesting that they might be useful as a natural blood thinner. The interesting thing we observed is that the green-synthesized CuNPs made from Acanthophora extract could be used in anticoagulation therapy.\n",

Sixty-two patients of DPN were randomly divided into a combined therapy group (31 cases) and a medication group (31 cases, 2 cases dropped out); besides, 20 healthy subjects were recruited as a normal group. On the base of routine intervention, in the medication group, thioctic acid capsules were administrated orally, 0.2 g each time, 3 times a day. In the combined therapy group, besides the medication as the medication group, acupuncture was performed on bilateral Quchi (LI 11), Waiguan (TE 5), Hegu (LI 4), Tianshu (ST 25), Zusanli (ST 36), Sanyinjiao (SP 6) and Taichong (LR 3) and the needles were retained for 30 min, acupuncture was delivered once daily, 6 times a week. The duration of treatment was 4 weeks in the two groups. The score of Toronto clinical scoring system (TCSS), the nerve conduction velocity of median nerve (MN) and common peroneal nerve (CPN) were observed before and after treatment in the two intervention groups; and the serum lipid metabolism was detected before and after treatment in the two intervention groups and the normal group. Compared with that before treatment, the scores of TCSS were reduced in the combined therapy group and the medication group (<i>P</i><0.05) after treatment, and the score decrease in the combined therapy group was larger than that of the medication group (<i>P</i><0.001). The motor nerve conduction velocity and the sensory nerve conductive velocity of MN and CPN after treatment all increased in the combined therapy group and the medication group compared with those before treatment (<i>P</i><0.05), and the improvements in the combined therapy group were larger than those of the medication group (<i>P</i><0.001). Before treatment DPN patients had 365 differential lipid metabolites, including sphingosine (SPH, d18:0), involved in the inositol phosphate metabolism, compared with the subjects of the normal group. There were 103 differential lipid metabolites in the medication group before and after treatment, including lysophosphatidyl ethanolamine (LPE, 18:1/0:0), participated in glycerophospholipid metabolism. In the combined therapy group, before and after treatment, there were 99 differential lipid metabolites, including lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC, 18:0/0:0), participated in the neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction. Acupuncture greatly affected 50 lipid metabolites such as lysophosphatidic acid (LPA, 0:0/22:6), LPA(0:0/18:2) and LPC(O-18:0), which was mainly involved in glycerophospholipid metabolism. Acupuncture combined with medication ameliorates the symptoms and the nerve conduction velocity in DPN patients, which may be related to the regulation of serum lipid metabolism.\n",
            "ID: 38764043, Title: Association of genetic variants related to combined lipid-lowering and antihypertensive therapies with risk of cardiovascular disease: 2 × 2 factorial Mendelian randomization analyses., Abstract: Lipid-lowering drugs and antihypertensive drugs are commonly combined for cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, the relationship of combined medications with CVD remains controversial. We aimed to explore the associations of genetically proxied medications of lipid-lowering and antihypertensive drugs, either alone or both, with risk of CVD, other clinical and safety outcomes. We divided 423,821 individuals in the UK Biobank into 4 groups via median genetic scores for targets of lipid-lowering drugs and antihypertensive drugs: lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) mediated by targets of statins or proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors, lower systolic blood pressure (SBP) mediated by targets of β-blockers (BBs) or calcium channel blockers (CCBs), combined genetically lower LDL-C and SBP, and reference (genetically both higher LDL-C and SBP). Associations with risk of CVD and other clinical outcomes were explored among each group in factorial Mendelian randomization. Independent and additive effects were observed between genetically proxied medications of lipid-lowering and antihypertensive drugs with CVD (including coronary artery disease, stroke, and peripheral artery diseases) and other clinical outcomes (ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, heart failure, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and dementia) (P > 0.05 for interaction in all outcomes). Take the effect of PCSK9 inhibitors and BBs on CVD for instance: compared with the reference, PCSK9 group had a 4% lower risk of CVD (odds ratio [OR], 0.96; 95%CI, 0.94-0.99), and a 3% lower risk was observed in BBs group (OR, 0.97; 95%CI, 0.94-0.99), while combined both were associated with a 6% additively lower risk (OR, 0.94; 95%CI, 0.92-0.97; P = 0.87 for interaction). Genetically proxied medications of combined lipid-lowering and antihypertensive drugs have an independent and additive effects on CVD, other clinical and safety outcomes, with implications for CVD clinical practice, subsequent trials as well as drug development of polypills.\n",
            "ID: 38764010, Title: NSUN2 affects diabetic retinopathy progression by regulating MUC1 expression through RNA m<sup>5</sup>C methylation., Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the leading cause of blinding eye disease among working adults and is primarily attributed to the excessive proliferation of microvessels, which leads to vitreous hemorrhage and retinal traction, thereby significantly impairing patient vision. NSUN2-mediated RNA m<sup>5</sup>C methylation is implicated in various diseases, and in this investigation, we focused on elucidating the impact of NSUN2 on the regulation of the expression of the downstream gene MUC1, specifically through RNA m<sup>5</sup>C methylation, on the progression of DR. Utilizing Microarray analysis, we examined patient vitreous fluid to pinpoint potential therapeutic targets for DR. Differential expression of NSUN2 was validated through qRT-PCR, Western blot, and immunofluorescence in human tissue, animal tissue, and cell model of DR. The relationship between NSUN2 and DR was explored in vitro and in vivo through gene knockdown and overexpression. Various techniques, such as MeRIP-qPCR and dot blot, were applied to reveal the downstream targets and mechanism of action of NSUN2. The levels of both NSUN2 and RNA m<sup>5</sup>C methylation were significantly elevated in the DR model. Knockdown of NSUN2 mitigated DR lesion formation both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, NSUN2 promoted MUC1 expression by binding to the RNA m<sup>5</sup>C reader ALYREF. Knockdown of ALYREF resulted in DR lesion alterations similar to those observed with NSUN2 knockdown. Moreover, MUC1 overexpression successfully reversed a series of DR alterations induced by NSUN2 silencing. NSUN2 regulates the expression of MUC1 through ALYREF-mediated RNA m<sup>5</sup>C methylation, thereby regulating the progression of DR and providing a new option for the treatment of DR in the future.\n",

It is necessary to find a safe, effective and sustainable way to delay and reverse the progression of prediabetes. Akkermansia muciniphila (A. muciniphila) is one of the key bacteria associated with glucose metabolism. Recent studies mainly focus on the effect of A. muciniphila on obesity and insulin resistance, but there is no research on the effect of A. muciniphila on pancreatic β-cell function and its mechanism in prediabetes. In this study, we investigated the effects of A. muciniphila on β-cell function, apoptosis and differentiation, as well as its effects on the gut microbiome, intestinal barrier, metaflammation and the expression of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in a high-fat diet (HFD)-induced prediabetic rat model. The effect of A. muciniphila was compared with dietary intervention. The results showed both A. muciniphila treatment and dietary intervention can reduce metaflammation by repairing the intestinal barrier in rats with prediabetes induced by an HFD and improve β-cell secretory function, apoptosis and differentiation through signaling pathways mediated by TLR2 and TLR4. Additionally, A. muciniphila can further elevate β-cell secretion, attenuate apoptosis and improve differentiation and the TLR signaling pathway on the basis of diet.\n",
            "ID: 38763922, Title: Assessment between antiseptic and normal saline for negative pressure wound therapy with instillation and dwell time in diabetic foot infections., Abstract: Negative pressure wound therapy with instillation and dwell time (NPWTi-d) is increasingly used for a diverse range of wounds. Meanwhile, the topical wound irrigation solution consisting of polyhexamethylene biguanide and betaine (PHMB-B) has shown efficacy in managing wound infections. However, the effectiveness of this solution as a topical instillation solution for NPWTi-d in patients with diabetic foot infections (DFIs) has not been thoroughly studied. The objective of this retrospective study was to evaluate the impact of using PHMB-B as the instillation solution during NPWTi-d on reducing bioburden and improving clinical outcomes in patients with DFIs. Between January 2017 and December 2022, a series of patients with DFIs received treatment with NPWTi-d, using either PHMB-B or normal saline as the instillation solution. Data collected retrospectively included demographic information, baseline wound characteristics, and treatment outcomes. The study included 61 patients in the PHMB-B group and 73 patients in the normal saline group, all diagnosed with DFIs. In comparison to patients treated with normal saline, patients with PHMB-B exhibited no significant differences in terms of wound bed preparation time (P = 0.5034), length of hospital stay (P = 0.6783), NPWTi-d application times (P = 0.1458), duration of systematic antimicrobial administration (P = 0.3567), or overall cost of hospitalization (P = 0.6713). The findings of the study suggest that the use of either PHMB-B or normal saline as an instillation solution in NPWTi-d for DFIs shows promise and effectiveness, yet no clinical distinction was observed between the two solutions.\n",

Their clinical and genetic features, treatment, and follow-up results were analyzed. <b>Results:</b> Among the 5 patients with MODY12 subtype, 4 were male and 1 was female, with an age of 13.4 (5.5, 14.6) years. Four of the patients were born large for gestational age, while one was born small for gestational age. Two patients were overweight or obese. Three patients exhibited typical symptoms of diabetes, while 2 were incidentally found to have elevated blood glucose level. One patient was found to have diabetic ketoacidosis at onset, who was diagnosed with congenital hyperinsulinism during the neonatal period and received diazoxide treatment, and experienced intellectual developmental delay. All 5 patients had autosomal dominant inherited diabetes within 3 generations. The fasting blood glucose at onset was 7.5 (6.5, 10.0) mmol/L, the haemoglobin, A1c (HbA1c) was 11.8% (7.5%, 13.5%), and the fasting C-peptide was 1.2 (1.1, 2.2)μg/L. The duration of follow-up was 15 (9, 32) months. One patient underwent lifestyle intervention, two received metformin orally, one received insulin therapy, and the other received subcutaneous injection of insulin combined with sulfonylurea orally. At the last follow-up, the median fasting blood glucose was 6.1 (5.1, 7.0) mmol/L, the HbA1c was 5.9% (5.7%, 7.1%), and the fasting C-peptide was 1.7 (0.9, 2.9)μg/L. One patient developed diabetic retinopathy. There were 4 missense variations in ABCC8 gene and one in-frame deletion, all of which were maternally inherited heterozygotes. <b>Conclusions:</b> MODY12 subtype is a heterogeneous disorder with the age of onset from infancy to adolescence. It can present as mild hyperglycemia or diabetic ketoacidosis, and has a high incidence of obesity. Definitive diagnosis can be achieved through genetic test, and individualized treatment is recommended based on glucose levels.\n",
            "ID: 38763818, Title: 5-Fluorouracil Induced Hypertriglyceridemia During the Colorectal Cancer Treatment in a Patient With Multifactorial Chylomicronemia Syndrome: A Case Report., Abstract: The case of a 47-year-old female patient who underwent sigmoidectomy for metastatic colorectal cancer is reported. Treatment with capecitabine and 5-fluorouracil induced severe hypertriglyceridemia repeatedly. Based on laboratory tests and clinical evaluations, treatment was suggested by specialists. After treatment with capecitabine, the patient's triglycerides increased from 19.7 mmol/L to 42 mmol/L. It was proposed that the patient had multifactorial chylomicronemia syndrome triggered by secondary factors. Statins, fenofibrate, ezetimib, and metformin were added to the therapy. After metastases appeared, FOLFIRI (leucovorin calcium [folinic acid], 5-fluorouracil, and irinotecan hydrochloride) chemotherapy and biological treatment (cetuximab) followed and triglycerides increased to 55.3 mmol/L. Monitoring triglyceride levels before and during therapy is suggested.\n",
            "ID: 38763677, Title: Anti-obesity and anti-diabetic bioactive peptides: A comprehensive review of their sources, properties, and techno-functional challenges., Abstract: The scourge of obesity arising from obesogens and poor dieting still ravages our planet as half of the global population may be overweight and obese by 2035. This metabolic disorder is intertwined with type 2 diabetes (T2D), both of which warrant alternative therapeutic options other than clinically approved drugs like orlistat with their tendency of abuse and side effects. In this review, we comprehensively describe the global obesity problem and its connection to T2D. Obesity, overconsumption of fats, the mechanism of fat digestion, obesogenic gut microbiota, inhibition of fat digestion, and natural anti-obesity compounds are discussed. Similar discussions are made for diabetes with regard to glucose regulation, the diabetic gut microbiota, and insulinotropic compounds. The sources and production of anti-obesity bioactive peptides (AOBPs) and anti-diabetic bioactive peptides (ADBPs) are also described while explaining their structure-function relationships, gastrointestinal behaviors, and action mechanisms. Finally, the techno-functional applications of AOBPs and ADBPs are highlighted.\n",
            "ID: 38763510, Title: Efficacy and Safety of Metformin and Atorvastatin Combination Therapy vs. Monotherapy with Either Drug in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Dyslipidemia Patients (ATOMIC): Double-Blinded Randomized Controlled Trial., Abstract: It is well known that a large number of patients with diabetes also have dyslipidemia, which significantly increases the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of combination drugs consisting of metformin and atorvastatin, widely used as therapeutic agents for diabetes and dyslipidemia. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group and phase III multicenter study included adults with glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels >7.0% and <10.0%, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) >100 and <250 mg/dL. One hundred eighty-five eligible subjects were randomized to the combination group (metformin+atorvastatin), metformin group (metformin+atorvastatin placebo), and atorvastatin group (atorvastatin+metformin placebo). The primary efficacy endpoints were the percent changes in HbA1c and LDL-C levels from baseline at the end of the treatment. After 16 weeks of treatment compared to baseline, HbA1c showed a significant difference of 0.94% compared to the atorvastatin group in the combination group (0.35% vs. -0.58%, respectively; P<0.0001), whereas the proportion of patients with increased HbA1c was also 62% and 15%, respectively, showing a significant difference (P<0.001). The combination group also showed a significant decrease in LDL-C levels compared to the metformin group (-55.20% vs. -7.69%, P<0.001) without previously unknown adverse drug events. The addition of atorvastatin to metformin improved HbA1c and LDL-C levels to a significant extent compared to metformin or atorvastatin alone in diabetes and dyslipidemia patients. This study also suggested metformin's preventive effect on the glucose-elevating potential of atorvastatin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and dyslipidemia, insufficiently controlled with exercise and diet. Metformin and atorvastatin combination might be an effective treatment in reducing the CVD risk in patients with both diabetes and dyslipidemia because of its lowering effect on LDL-C and glucose.\n",
            "ID: 38763496, Title: Effect of astaxanthin in type-2 diabetes -induced APPxhQC transgenic and NTG mice., Abstract: Aggregation and misfolding of amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau proteins, suggested to arise from post-translational modification processes, are thought to be the main cause of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Additionally, a plethora of evidence exists that links metabolic dysfunctions such as obesity, type 2 diabetes (T2D), and dyslipidemia to the pathogenesis of AD. We thus investigated the combinatory effect of T2D and human glutaminyl cyclase activity (pyroglutamylation), on the pathology of AD and whether astaxanthin (ASX) treatment ameliorates accompanying pathophysiological manifestations. Male transgenic AD mice, APPxhQC, expressing human APP751 with the Swedish and the London mutation and human glutaminyl cyclase (hQC) enzyme and their non-transgenic (NTG) littermates were used. Both APPxhQC and NTG mice were allocated to 3 groups, control, T2D-control, and T2D-ASX. Mice were fed control or high fat diet ± ASX for 13 weeks starting at an age of 11-12 months. High fat diet fed mice were further treated with streptozocin for T2D induction. Effects of genotype, T2D induction, and ASX treatment were evaluated by analysing glycemic readouts, lipid concentration, Aβ deposition, hippocampus-dependent cognitive function and nutrient sensing using immunosorbent assay, ELISA-based assays, western blotting, immunofluorescence staining, and behavioral testing via Morris water maze (MWM), respectively. APPxhQC mice presented a higher glucose sensitivity compared to NTG mice. T2D-induced brain dysfunction was more severe in NTG compared to the APPxhQC mice. T2D induction impaired memory functions while increasing hepatic LC3B, ABCA1, and p65 levels in NTG mice. T2D induction resulted in a progressive shift of Aβ from the soluble to insoluble form in APPxhQC mice. ASX treatment reversed T2D- induced memory dysfunction in NTG mice and in parallel increased hepatic pAKT while decreasing p65 and increasing cerebral p-S6rp and p65 levels. ASX treatment reduced soluble Aβ38 and Aβ40 and insoluble Aβ40 levels in T2D-induced APPxhQC mice. We demonstrate that T2D induction in APPxhQC mice poses additional risk for AD pathology as seen by increased Aβ deposition. Although ASX treatment reduced Aβ expression in T2D-induced APPxhQC mice and rescued T2D-induced memory impairment in NTG mice, ASX treatment alone may not be effective in cases of T2D comorbidity and AD.\n",
            "ID: 38763495, Title: A Novel Fatty Acid Mimetic with Pan-PPAR Partial Agonist Activity Inhibits Diet-Induced Obesity and Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease., Abstract: The prevalence of metabolic diseases is increasing globally at an alarming rate; thus, it is essential that effective, accessible, low-cost therapeutics are developed. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are transcription factors that tightly regulate glucose homeostasis and lipid metabolism and are important drug targets for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and dyslipidemia. We previously identified LDT409, a fatty acid-like compound derived from cashew nut shell liquid, as a novel pan-active PPARα/γ/δ compound. Herein, we aimed to assess the efficacy of LDT409 in vivo and investigate the molecular mechanisms governing the actions of the fatty acid mimetic LDT409 in diet-induced obese mice. C57Bl/6 mice (8-month-old) were fed a chow or high fat diet (HFD) for 4 weeks; mice thereafter received once daily intraperitoneal injections of vehicle, 10 mg/kg Rosiglitazone, 40 mg/kg WY14643, or 40 mg/kg LDT409 for 18 days while continuing the HFD. During treatments, body weight, food intake, glucose and insulin tolerance, energy expenditure, and intestinal lipid absorption were measured. On day 18 of treatment, tissues and plasma were collected for histological, molecular, and biochemical analysis. We found that treatment with LDT409 was effective at reversing HFD-induced obesity and associated metabolic abnormalities in mice. LDT409 lowered food intake and hyperlipidemia, while improving insulin tolerance. Despite being a substrate of both PPARα and PPARγ, LDT409 was crucial for promoting hepatic fatty acid oxidation and reducing hepatic steatosis in HFD-fed mice. We also highlighted a role for LDT409 in white and brown adipocytes in vitro and in vivo where it decreased fat accumulation, increased lipolysis, induced browning of WAT, and upregulated thermogenic gene Ucp1. Remarkably, LDT409 reversed HFD-induced weight gain back to chow-fed control levels. We determined that the LDT409-induced weight-loss was associated with a combination of increased energy expenditure (detectable before weight loss was apparent), decreased food intake, increased systemic fat utilization, and increased fecal lipid excretion in HFD-fed mice. Collectively, LDT409 represents a fatty acid mimetic that generates a uniquely favorable metabolic response for the treatment of multiple abnormalities including obesity, dyslipidemia, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, and diabetes. LDT409 is derived from a highly abundant natural product-based starting material and its development could be pursued as a therapeutic solution to the global metabolic health crisis.\n",
            "ID: 38763410, Title: Antidiabetic properties of Caffeoylmalic acid, a bioactive natural compound isolated from Urtica dioica., Abstract: The uncontrolled hyperglycemia that characterizes diabetes mellitus (DM) causes several complications in the organism. DM is among the major causes of deaths, and the limited efficacy of current treatments push the search for novel drug candidates, also among natural compounds. We focused our attention on caffeoylmalic acid, a phenolic derivative extracted from Urtica dioica, a plant investigated for its potential against type 2 DM. This compound was tested for its antidiabetic activity in vitro through a glucose uptake assay, in vivo in a mouse DM model and through molecular docking towards α-amylase and α-glucosidase. The effects on glucose blood level, liver enzymes, insulin and creatinine levels as well as on lipid and blood parameters, considered biochemical markers of diabetes, were also evaluated. The results showed an antidiabetic activity in vitro and in vivo, as the compound stimulates glucose absorbtion and reduces blood glucose levels. Moreover, it ameliorates lipid profile, liver and blood parameters, with moderate effect on insulin secretion. Taken together, these findings pave the way for the compounds from this class of caffeoylmalic acid as potential antidiabetic compounds.\n",
            "ID: 38763355, Title: β-hydroxybutyrate alleviates neurological deficits by restoring glymphatic and inflammation after subarachnoid hemorrhage in mice., Abstract: Both glymphatic system dysfunction and inflammatory response aggravate neurological dysfunction after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Studies have shown that β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) may mitigate painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN) by upregulating SNTA1 expression and reinstating AQP4 polarity. However, the potential of BHB to ameliorate glymphatic system function and inflammatory response in SAH mice remains uncertain. The SAH models were constructed by injection of arterial blood into cisterna Magana. Three groups of C57 mice were randomly assigned: Sham, SAH, and BHB. All mice were subjected to neurological function assessment, western blot, immunofluorescence double staining, and RNA-seq. Glymphatic system function was examined with tracer and immunofluorescence double staining, and the differential genes were examined with RNA-seq. In addition, the expression of related inflammation was detected. Compared with the SAH group, BHB reinstated AQP4 polarization by upregulating SNTA1 protein to enhance the glymphatic system. According to RNA-seq, the different genes were primarily connected to microglia activation, astrocytes, and inflammation. Western blot and immunofluorescence further confirmed that the related inflammatory protein expression levels were upregulated. BHB attenuated neuroinflammation after SAH. Ultimately, it can mitigate the neurological deficits in SAH mice. The study reveals a novel mechanism that BHB treatment mitigates neurologic impairment in SAH mice. We propose that BHB may play a neuroprotective effect by enhancing glymphatic system function and attenuating neuroinflammatory subarachnoid hemorrhage.\n",
            "ID: 38763181, Title: Recent advances in the effect of adipose tissue inflammation on insulin resistance., Abstract: Obesity is one of the major risk factors for diabetes. Excessive accumulation of fat leads to inflammation of adipose tissue, which can increase the risk of developing diabetes.. Obesity-related chronic inflammation can result in anomalies in glucose-lipid metabolism and insulin resistance, and it is a major cause of β-cell dysfunction in diabetes mellitus. Thus, a long-term tissue inflammatory response is crucial for metabolic diseases, particularly type 2 diabetes. Chronic inflammation associated with obesity increases oxidative stress, secretes inflammatory factors, modifies endocrine variables, and interferes with insulin signalling pathways, all of which contribute to insulin resistance and glucose tolerance. Insulin resistance and diabetes are ultimately caused by chronic inflammation in the stomach, pancreas, liver, muscle, and fat tissues. In this article, we systematically summarize the latest research progress on the mechanisms of adipose tissue inflammation and insulin resistance, as well as the mechanisms of cross-talk between adipose tissue inflammation and insulin resistance, with a view to providing some meaningful therapeutic strategies for the treatment of insulin resistance by controlling adipose tissue inflammation.\n",
            "ID: 38763169, Title: Prevalence of skin problems caused by insulin pump therapy and associated factors in children with type 1 diabetes mellitus: A large cross-sectional survey in China., Abstract: To document the prevalence of skin problems associated with insulin pump use and identify contributing factors among children with type 1 diabetes mellitus in China. In total, 461 children were recruited from an online community (i.e., a Wechat group) of pediatric patients with T1DM. A self-developed questionnaire was filled in by parents, collecting the information on social demographics, disease, and insulin pump therapy related characteristics and skin problems. We applied the Mann-Whitney U test, Chi square test and logistic regression analysis to identify the factors associated with skin problems. Of the 461 responders, 308 (66.8 %) children were reported to have skin problems. More specifically, 38.8 % had pigmentation changes, 22.3 % allergy/dermatitis, 20.2 % scaring, 11.5 % pain, 10.8 % infection, 10.6 % subcutaneous lipohypertrophy, and 6.1 % lipoatrophy. Logistic regression analysis showed that independent associated factors of skin problems were the caregiver's educational level as college or above, patient having skin allergies, and using the Brand 2 insulin pump (p values < 0.05). The present study documents the prevalence of skin problems and identifies associated factors, such as caregiver's education, patients skin allergies, and using a specific brand of pump. Health education should address these factors in addition to the traditionally emphasized factors.\n",

This observational study used Dexcom CGM device data linked with EHR (from 2015-2020) for a large national cohort of diabetes patients. We tracked the initiation and consistency of CGM use, assessed concordance of CGM use and measures of glucose control between CGM device data and EHR records, and examined results by age, ethnicity, and diabetes type. The time from pharmacy release of CGM to patients to initiation of uploading CGM data to Dexcom servers averaged three weeks but demonstrated wide variation among individuals; importantly, this delay decreased markedly over the later years. The average daily wear time of CGM exceeded 22 hours over nearly three years of follow-up. Patterns of CGM use were generally consistent across age, race/ethnicity groups and diabetes type. There was strong concordance between EHR-based estimates of CGM use and Dexcom CGM wear time and between estimates of glucose control from both sources. The study demonstrates our ability to reliably integrate CGM devices and EHR data to provide valuable insights into CGM use patterns. The results indicate in the real-world environment that CGM is worn consistently over many years for both type 1 and type 2 patients within the Veterans Affairs Healthcare System and is similar across major race/ethnicity and age groups.\n",
            "ID: 38768416, Title: Continuous glucose monitoring and recreational scuba diving in type 1 diabetes: head-to-head comparison between Free Style Libre 3 and Dexcom G7 performance., Abstract: Background Scuba diving was previously excluded because of hypoglycemic risks for type 1 diabetic patients (T1DM). Specific eligibility criteria and a safety protocol have been defined, while continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems have enhanced diabetes management. This study aims to assess the feasibility and accuracy of CGM Dexcom G7 (DG7) and Free Style Libre 3 (FSL3) in a setting of repetitive scuba diving in T1DM, exploring the possibility of non-adjunctive use. Material and methods The study was conducted during an event of Diabete Sommerso® association in November 2023. Participants followed a safety protocol, with capillary glucose as reference standard (Beurer GL50Evo). Sensors accuracy was evaluated through Median and Mean Absolute Relative Difference (MeARD and MARD) and Surveillance Error Grid (SEG) Analysis. Sub-analyses were performed by glycemic range, timing, gender. Data distribution and correlation was estimated by Spearman test and Bland-Altman plots. The ability of sensors to identify hypoglycaemia was assessed by contingency tables. Participants completed a satisfation questionnaire. Results Data from 202 dives of 13 patients were collected. The overall MARD was 31% for DG7 and 14.2% for FSL3, MeARD 19.7% and 11.6% respectively. FSL3 exhibited better accuracy in normoglycemic and hyperglycemic ranges. SEG analysis showed 82.1% (DG7) and 97.4% (FSL3) data on no-risk zone. FSL3 better performed on hypoglycemia identification (diagnostic odds ratio of 254.10 vs 58.95). Neither of sensors reached the MARD for non-adjunctive use. Patient satisfaction favored FSL3 for size and minimal bulk, while DG7 received positive feedback for versatility. Conclusions The study reveals FSL3 superior accuracy compared to DG7 in a setting of repetitive scuba diving in T1DM, except for hypoglycemic range. Both sensors fails to achieve accuracy for non-adjunctive use. Capillary tests remain crucial for safe dive planning, and sensor data should be interpreted cautiously. We suggest exploring additional factors potentially influencing sensor performance.\n",

            "ID: 38768366, Title: Glucose Regulation of β-Cell KATP Channels: It Is Time for a New Model!, Abstract: An agreed-upon consensus model of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from healthy β-cells is essential for understanding diabetes pathophysiology. Since the discovery of the KATP channel in 1984, an oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos)-driven rise in ATP has been assumed to close KATP channels to initiate insulin secretion. This model lacks any evidence, genetic or otherwise, that mitochondria possess the bioenergetics to raise the ATP/ADP ratio to the triggering threshold, and conflicts with genetic evidence demonstrating that OxPhos is dispensable for insulin secretion. It also conflates the stoichiometric yield of OxPhos with thermodynamics, and overestimates OxPhos by failing to account for established features of β-cell metabolism, such as leak, anaplerosis, cataplerosis, and NADPH production that subtract from the efficiency of mitochondrial ATP production. We have proposed an alternative model, based on the spatial and bioenergetic specializations of β-cell metabolism, in which glycolysis initiates insulin secretion. The evidence for this model includes that 1) glycolysis has high control strength over insulin secretion; 2) glycolysis is active at the correct time to explain KATP channel closure; 3) plasma membrane-associated glycolytic enzymes control KATP channels; 4) pyruvate kinase has favorable bioenergetics, relative to OxPhos, for raising ATP/ADP; and 5) OxPhos stalls before membrane depolarization and increases after. Although several key experiments remain to evaluate this model, the 1984 model is based purely on circumstantial evidence and must be rescued by causal, mechanistic experiments if it is to endure.\n",
            "ID: 38768365, Title: Glucose Regulation of β-Cell KATP Channels: Is a New Model Needed?, Abstract: The canonical model of glucose-induced increase in insulin secretion involves the metabolism of glucose via glycolysis and the citrate cycle, resulting in increased ATP synthesis by the respiratory chain and the closure of ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channels. The resulting plasma membrane depolarization, followed by Ca2+ influx through L-type Ca2+ channels, then induces insulin granule fusion. Merrins and colleagues have recently proposed an alternative model whereby KATP channels are controlled by pyruvate kinase, using glycolytic and mitochondrial phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to generate microdomains of high ATP/ADP immediately adjacent to KATP channels. This model presents several challenges. First, how mitochondrially generated PEP, but not ATP produced abundantly by the mitochondrial F1F0-ATP synthase, can gain access to the proposed microdomains is unclear. Second, ATP/ADP fluctuations imaged immediately beneath the plasma membrane closely resemble those in the bulk cytosol. Third, ADP privation of the respiratory chain at high glucose, suggested to drive alternating, phased-locked generation by mitochondria of ATP or PEP, has yet to be directly demonstrated. Finally, the approaches used to explore these questions may be complicated by off-target effects. We suggest instead that Ca2+ changes, well known to affect both ATP generation and consumption, likely drive cytosolic ATP/ADP oscillations that in turn regulate KATP channels and membrane potential. Thus, it remains to be demonstrated that a new model is required to replace the existing, mitochondrial bioenergetics-based model.\n",

            "ID: 38768242, Title: Transgender health objectives of training for adult Endocrinology and Metabolism programs: Outcomes of a modified-Delphi study., Abstract: Transgender people encounter significant barriers when seeking timely, high-quality healthcare, resulting in unmet medical needs with increased rates of diabetes, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and HIV. The paucity of postgraduate medical education to invest in standardization of transgender health training sustains these barriers, leaving physicians feeling unprepared and averse to provide transgender health care. Closing this education gap and improving transgender healthcare necessitates the development of consensus-built transgender health objectives of training (THOOT), particularly in Adult Endocrinology and Metabolism Residency programs. We conducted a two-round modified-Delphi process involving a nationally representative panel of experts, including Adult Endocrinology and Metabolism program directors, physician content experts, residents, and transgender community members, to identify THOOT for inclusion in Canadian Endocrinology and Metabolism Residency programs. Participants used a 5-point Likert scale to assess THOOT importance for curricular inclusion, with opportunities for written feedback. Data was collected through Qualtrics and analyzed after each round. In the first Delphi round, panelists reviewed and rated 81 literature extracted THOOT, achieving consensus on all objectives. Following panelists' feedback, 5 THOOT were added, 9 removed, 34 consolidated into 12 objectives, and 47 were rephrased or retained. In the second Delphi round, panelists assessed 55 THOOT. Consensus was established for 8 THOOT. Program directors' post-Delphi feedback further consolidated objectives to arrive at 4 THOOT for curriculum inclusion. To our knowledge, this is the first time a consensus-based approach has been used to establish THOOT for any subspecialty postgraduate medicine program across Canada or the United States. Our results lay the foundation towards health equity and social justice in transgender health medical education, offering a blueprint for future innovations.\n",
            "ID: 38768222, Title: A novel fusion of genetic grey wolf optimization and kernel extreme learning machines for precise diabetic eye disease classification., Abstract: In response to the growing number of diabetes cases worldwide, Our study addresses the escalating issue of diabetic eye disease (DED), a significant contributor to vision loss globally, through a pioneering approach. We propose a novel integration of a Genetic Grey Wolf Optimization (G-GWO) algorithm with a Fully Convolutional Encoder-Decoder Network (FCEDN), further enhanced by a Kernel Extreme Learning Machine (KELM) for refined image segmentation and disease classification. This innovative combination leverages the genetic algorithm and grey wolf optimization to boost the FCEDN's efficiency, enabling precise detection of DED stages and differentiation among disease types. Tested across diverse datasets, including IDRiD, DR-HAGIS, and ODIR, our model showcased superior performance, achieving classification accuracies between 98.5% to 98.8%, surpassing existing methods. This advancement sets a new standard in DED detection and offers significant potential for automating fundus image analysis, reducing reliance on manual examination, and improving patient care efficiency. Our findings are crucial to enhancing diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes in DED management.\n",
            "ID: 38768161, Title: Design of a bi-directional methodology for automated assessment of compliance to continuous application of clinical guidelines, and its evaluation in the type 2 diabetes domain., Abstract: We introduce a new approach for automated guideline-based-care quality assessment, the bidirectional knowledge-based assessment of compliance (BiKBAC) method, and the DiscovErr system, which implements it. Our methodology compares the guideline's Asbru-based formal representation, including its intentions, with the longitudinal medical record, using a top-down and bottom-up approach. Partial matches are resolved using fuzzy temporal logic. The system was evaluated in the type 2 Diabetes management domain, comparing it to three expert clinicians, including two diabetes experts. The system and the experts commented on the management of 10 patients, randomly selected from 2,000 diabetes patients. On average, each record spanned 5.23 years; the data included 1,584 medical transactions. The system provided 279 comments. The experts made 181 different unique comments. The completeness (recall) of the system was 91% when the gold standard was comments made by at least two of the three experts, and 98%, compared to comments made by all three experts. The experts also assessed all of the 114 medication-therapy-related comments, and a random 35% of the 165 tests-and-monitoring-related comments. The system's correctness (precision) was 81%, compared to comments judged as correct by both diabetes experts, and 91%, compared to comments judged as correct by one diabetes expert and at least as partially correct by the other. 89% of the comments were judged as important by both diabetes experts, 8% were judged as important by one expert, and 3% were judged as less important by both experts. Adding the validated system comments to the experts' comments, the completeness scores of the experts were 75%, 60%, and 55%; the expert correctness scores were respectively 99%, 91%, and 88%. Thus, the system could be ranked first in completeness and second in correctness. We conclude that systems such as DiscovErr can effectively assess the quality of continuous guideline-based care.\n",
            "ID: 38768159, Title: Factors associated with oral health care behavior of people with type 2 diabetes mellitus: A hospital-based, cross-sectional study., Abstract: Oral healthcare behavior determines oral health status and the incidence of oral diseases. People with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are at-risk of having low oral healthcare behavior and disease-related oral health. To investigate the oral health status and factors associated with oral healthcare behavior among people with T2DM in Thailand. In total, 401 people with T2DM participated in the study based on their attendance at a non-communicable disease clinic at sub-district health promotion hospitals in Bueng Kan, a north-eastern province in Thailand. A structured questionnaire was used to obtain variables of interest. Linear regression analysis at the 95% confidence interval (CI) was applied. The majority of participants were female (73.8%). More than three-quarters had more than 20 permanent teeth (77.6%), a decay missing filling tooth index was 10.6 teeth/person. Many participants had four permanent occlusal pairs (69.6%), had tooth decay (74.6%), and some participants had tooth filling (32.2%). Statistically significant factors associated with oral healthcare behavior were: having complications associated with diabetes mellitus (Beta = -0.097, 95%CI = -1.653, -0.046), oral health literacy (Beta = 0.119, 95%CI = 0.009, 0.150), educational level (Beta = 0.123, 95%CI = 0.103, 0.949), oral healthcare attitude (Beta = 0.258, 95%CI = 0.143, 0.333), and oral health services (Beta = 0.430, 95%CI = 0.298, 1.408). People with T2DM had good oral health status. People with T2DM with low oral health literacy, low attitude, and low level of oral health services were at a higher risk of poor oral healthcare behavior.\n",
            "ID: 38768141, Title: Prevalence of dyslipidemia, hypertension and diabetes among tribal and rural population in a south Indian forested region., Abstract: While NCDs are in rise globally, tribal and rural populations residing near to reserve forests with limited exposure to modern lifestyles may bear a unique burden. This study investigates the prevalence and risk factors of hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia among these communities. We conducted a cross-sectional study between 2018 and 2020 in the forest-dwelling population of Chamarajanagar, India. Using multistage stratified sampling based on caste and remoteness, we enrolled 608 participants aged over 18 years, including 259 non-tribal and 349 tribal individuals. Data collection includes the administration of STEPS questionnaire and measurement of fasting blood sugar, lipid levels, and blood pressure. The prevalence of diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia were 4.6%, 28.8%, and 85.7%, respectively, among the study population. We also found abnormal levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), Triglycerides (TGA), Total cholesterol (TC), and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)in 4.9%, 82.4%, 22.7%, 5.8%, and 7.4% of participants, respectively. Significant differences were observed in diabetes, LDL abnormality, TGA abnormality, VLDL abnormality, and TC abnormality, but not in hypertension, dyslipidemia, or HDL abnormality, across the Socio Geographic Discrimination Index. We found a significant difference in diabetes and HDL abnormality, but not in hypertension, dyslipidemia, LDL abnormality, TGA abnormality, TC abnormality, or VLDL abnormality, between tribal and non-tribal populations living in the forest-dwelling area. Waist circumference was a significant independent predictor of diabetes among tribal participants, while wealth index, age, and waist circumference were significant predictors of hypertension. There were no significant predictors for dyslipidemia among tribal participants. Our study suggests that tribal population living in a remote area are at a lower risk of developing diabetes compared to non-tribal populations living in the same geographic area. However, the prevalence of hypertension and dyslipidemia among tribal populations remains high and comparable to that of the general population.\n",
            "ID: 38768125, Title: Glucose Responsive Coacervate Protocells from Microfluidics for Diabetic Wound Healing., Abstract: The hyperglycemic pathophysiological environment in diabetic wounds is a major obstacle that impedes the healing process. Glucose-responsive wound healing materials are a promising approach to address this challenge. In this study, complex coacervate-based protocells are introduced for diabetic wound healing. By employing a microfluidic chip with an external mechanical vibrator, uniform coacervate microdroplets are generated via electrostatic interactions between diethylaminoethyl-dextran and double-stranded DNA. The spontaneous assembly of a phospholipid membrane on the droplet surface enhances its biocompatibility. Glucose oxidase and copper peroxide nanodots are integrated into microdroplets, enabling a glucose-responsive cascade that produces hydroxyl radicals as antibacterial agents. These features contribute to efficient antibacterial activity and wound healing in diabetic mice. The present protocells facilitate intelligent wound management, and the design of cascade catalytic coacervates can contribute to the development of various smart vehicles for drug delivery.\n",
            "ID: 38768121, Title: Exploring the path to optimal diabetes care by unravelling the contextual factors affecting access, utilisation, and quality of primary health care in West Africa: A scoping review protocol., Abstract: The prevalence of diabetes in West Africa is increasing, posing a major public health threat. An estimated 24 million Africans have diabetes, with rates in West Africa around 2-6% and projected to rise 129% by 2045 according to the WHO. Over 90% of cases are Type 2 diabetes (IDF, World Bank). As diabetes is ambulatory care sensitive, good primary care is crucial to reduce complications and mortality. However, research on factors influencing diabetes primary care access, utilisation and quality in West Africa remains limited despite growing disease burden. While research has emphasised diabetes prevalence and risk factors in West Africa, there remains limited evidence on contextual influences on primary care. This scoping review aims to address these evidence gaps. Using the established methodology by Arksey and O'Malley, this scoping review will undergo six stages. The review will adopt the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Extension for Scoping Review (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines to ensure methodological rigour. We will search four electronic databases and search through grey literature sources to thoroughly explore the topic. The identified articles will undergo thorough screening. We will collect data using a standardised data extraction form that covers study characteristics, population demographics, and study methods. The study will identify key themes and sub-themes related to primary healthcare access, utilisation, and quality. We will then analyse and summarise the data using a narrative synthesis approach. The findings and conclusive report will be finished and sent to a peer-reviewed publication within six months. This review protocol aims to systematically examine and assess the factors that impact the access, utilisation, and standard of primary healthcare services for diabetes in West Africa.\n",
            "ID: 38768080, Title: A national audit of facilities, human and material resources for the comprehensive management of diabetes in Ghana-A 2023 update., Abstract: The human and material resources as well as the systems for managing diabetes in Africa are inadequate. This study or needs assessment, aimed at updating the human and material resources, identifying the gaps and unmet needs for comprehensive diabetes care in Ghana. We conducted a national audit of 122 facilities in all 16 administrative regions of Ghana. Information obtained covered areas on personnel and multidisciplinary teams, access to medications, access to laboratory services, financing, screening services, management of diabetes complications, and availability/use of diabetes guidelines or protocols. Data was analysed using STATA version 16.1. P-values <0.05 were set as significant. Only 85(69.7%) out of the 122 surveyed facilities had a dedicated centre or service for diabetes care. Twenty-eight (23%) had trained diabetes doctors/specialists; and whilst most centres had ophthalmic nurses and dieticians, majority of them did not have trained diabetes educators (nurses), psychologists, ophthalmologists, podiatrists, and foot/vascular surgeons. Also, 13.9% had monofilaments, none could perform urine dipstick for microalbumin; 5 (4.1%) and just over 50% could perform laboratory microalbumin estimation and glycated haemoglobin, respectively. Access to and supply of human insulins was better than analogue insulin in most centres. Nearly 100% of the institutions surveyed had access to metformin and sulphonylurea with good to excellent supply in most cases, whilst access to Sodium Glucose Transporter-2 inhibitors and Glucagon-like peptide-1 analogues were low, and moderate for Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors and thiazolidinediones. Majority of the health facilities (95.1%) offered NHIS as payment mechanism for clients, whilst 68.0% and 30.3% of the patients paid for services using out-of-pocket and private insurance respectively. Fifteen facilities (12.3%) had Diabetes Support Groups in their locality and catchment areas. An urgent multisectoral collaboration, including prioritisation of resources at the facility level, to promote and achieve acceptable comprehensive diabetes care is required.\n",
            "ID: 38768058, Title: Metabolic dysregulation in obese women and the carcinogenesis of gynecological tumors: A review., Abstract: Obesity is a significant health issue associated with increased cancer risks, including gynecological malignancies. The worldwide rise in obesity rates is significantly impacting both cancer development and treatment outcomes. Adipose tissue plays a crucial role in metabolism, secreting various substances that can influence cancer formation. In obese individuals, dysfunctional adipose tissue can contribute to cancer development through inflammation, insulin resistance, hormonal changes, and abnormal cholesterol metabolism. Studies have shown a strong correlation between obesity and gynecological cancers, particularly endometrial and breast cancers. Obesity not only increases the risk of developing these cancers but is also associated with poorer outcomes. Additionally, obesity affects the perioperative management of gynecological cancers, requiring specialized care due to increased complications and resistance to therapy. Treatment strategies for managing metabolic dysregulation in patients with gynecological cancers include weight management, statin therapy, and insulin-sensitizing medications. Emerging studies suggest that interventions like intermittent fasting and caloric restriction may enhance the effectiveness of cancer treatments. Furthermore, targeting cholesterol metabolism, such as with statins or proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors, shows potential in cancer therapy. In conclusion, addressing metabolic issues, particularly obesity, is crucial in preventing and treating gynecological malignancies. Personalized approaches focusing on weight management and metabolic reprogramming may improve outcomes in these patients.\n",
            "ID: 38768051, Title: Fractures in Patients With Diabetes Mellitus: Findings From a 20-year Registry at a Single Level 1 Trauma Center., Abstract: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a risk factor of infection. Although DM has been associated with worse functional outcomes after acetabular fracture, literature regarding the effect of DM on surgical site infection and other early complications is lacking. A 20-year registry from a level 1 trauma center was queried to identify 134 patients with DM and 345 nondiabetic patients with acetabular fractures. The diabetic patient population was older (57.2 versus 43.2; P < 0.001) and had higher average body mass index (33.6 versus 29.5; P < 0.001). Eighty-three patients with DM and 270 nondiabetics were treated surgically (62% versus 78%; P < 0.001). Diabetic patients who were younger (54.6 versus 61.4; P = 0.01) with fewer comorbidities (1.7 versus 2.2; P = 0.04) were more frequently managed surgically. On univariate analysis, patients with DM more commonly developed any early infection (28.4% versus 21%; P = 0.049) but were no more likely to develop surgical site infection, or other postoperative complications. Older patient age, length of stay, baseline pulmonary disease, and concurrent abdominal injury were independent predictors of postoperative infection other than surgical site infection. Diabetics that developed infection had more comorbidities (2.4 versus 1.5; P < 0.001) and higher Injury Severity Score (24.1 versus 15.8; P = 0.003), and were more frequently insulin-dependent (72.7% versus 41%; P = 0.01). Independent of management strategy, diabetic patients were more likely to develop an infection after acetabular fracture. Insulin dependence was associated with postoperative infection on univariate analysis. Optimal selection of surgical candidates among patients with DM may limit postoperative infections.\n",
            "ID: 38767891, Title: Factors associated to hemoglobin decrease after percutaneous nephrolithotomy: a retrospective study., Abstract: This study aims to determine the preoperative and perioperative risk parameters associated with a decrease in hemoglobin (Hb) in patients undergoing percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL). We collected prospective data of consecutive patients who underwent PCNL from January 2018 to December 2022. The median decrease in post-operative hemoglobin levels compared to pre-operative was found to be 1.5 g/dl. This value was the cut-off value that divided the sample into two groups. Group 1 has a decrease in Hb levels that is higher or equal to the cutoff, group 2 has a decrease in Hb levels that is lower than the cut-off. All preoperative, stone characteristics and perioperative factors were recorded. A total of 273 patients were included in the study, 141 in Group 1 and 132 in Group 2. The mean age of Group 1 was significantly higher (55.48 ± 8.73 vs 45.9 ± 10.75 years, p < 0.05). The mean bleeding of Group 1 was significantly higher (285.85 ± 113.68 vs 135 ± 77.54 ml, p < 0.05). There was a significant difference in mean operation time between groups (86.35 ± 32.05 vs 64.89 ± 27.83 min, p < 0.05). Multivariate analysis showed that the variables age, comorbid diabetes mellitus, intraoperative bleeding amount, and operation time had a significant relationship with Hb reduction in patients undergoing PCNL (p < 0.05). Older age, comorbid diabetes mellitus, large amounts of intraoperative bleeding, and longer operating time are factors associated with PCNL-related postoperative hemoglobin decrease.\n",

RBP3 concentration was measured by custom-developed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in aqueous and correlated with vitreous concentrations in patients from the 50-Year Medalist study and Beetham Eye Institute at Joslin Diabetes Center. Aqueous RBP3 concentration (N = 131) was elevated in eyes with no to mild DR (mean ± SD 0.7 nM ± 0.2) and decreased in eyes with moderate to severe DR (0.65 nM ± 0.3) and proliferative DR (0.5 nM ± 0.2, P < 0.001) compared to eyes without diabetes. Aqueous and vitreous RBP3 concentrations correlated with each other (r = 0.34, P = 0.001) and between fellow eyes (P < 0.0001). History of retinal surgery did not affect aqueous RBP3 concentrations, but cataract surgery affected both vitreous and aqueous levels. Elevated aqueous RBP3 concentration associated with increased thickness of the outer nuclear layer (P = 0.004) and correlated with hemoglobin A1c, whereas vitreous RBP3 concentrations correlated with diabetic systemic complications. These findings suggest that aqueous RBP3 concentration may be an important endogenous clinical retinal protective factor, a biomarker for DR severity, and a promising VEGF-independent clinical intervention target in DR.\n",
            "ID: 38767849, Title: ASSOCIATION OF MACULAR STRUCTURE WITH MICROPERIMETRY SENSITIVITY FOLLOWING VITRECTOMY FOR PROLIFERATE DIABETIC RETINOPATHY., Abstract: To evaluate macular sensitivity using microperimetry in patients with proliferate diabetic retinopathy following vitrectomy and to investigate the relationship between the sensitivity and foveal microstructures with optical coherence tomography/angiography. Eighty-four eyes of 84 patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy, who were indicated for vitrectomy, had no intraocular surgery history 3 months preoperatively, and were able to ensure fundus examination after the vitrectomy, were included. A logMAR best-corrected visual acuity, macular sensitivity of microperimetry, macular retinal thickness, and macular vessel perfusion using optical coherence tomography/angiography were examined at 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months postoperatively. The logMAR best-corrected visual acuity and mean macular sensitivity of patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy improved postoperatively (P < 0.05). There was a significant correlation between best-corrected visual acuity and mean sensitivity (P < 0.05). Postoperative mean macular sensitivity was significantly correlated with outer retinal thickness in the 0 to 6 mm macular area (P < 0.05) and also significantly correlated with deep capillary plexus perfusion (P < 0.05). Fixation stability and mean macular sensitivity did not show any correlation with glycated hemoglobin, triglyceride, serum total cholesterol, carbamide, and creatinine and duration of diabetes mellitus (P > 0.05). Postoperative mean macular sensitivity was significantly correlated with outer retinal thickness and deep capillary plexus perfusion for patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy. The authors found that the visual performance of patients can be evaluated by the outer retinal thickness and deep capillary plexus perfusion, so optical coherence tomography/angiography examination can be an important prognostic factor for visual performance in patients.Clinical Trial Registration: This trial is registered with the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (http://www.chictr.org.cn; Registration No.: ChiCTR2100043399).\n",

CVDs are of great concern in the disease progression and prognosis of T2DM. This review is a comprehensive examination of the literature on the relationship between T2DM and cardiovascular risk, nutrition-related cardiometabolic risk (CMR) factors, and impact of dietary modulations on CMR. In recent years the researches has been focus on the importance of a comprehensive treatment approach like dietary modulations to address multiple cardiovascular risk reductions, including hypertension and dyslipidemia. Modulation of dietary patterns are the most promising interventions to prevent CMR factors and T2DM via affecting the body weight, glucose control, and microbial diversity of individuals. Current evidence suggests that high-quality dietary patterns such as the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan and the Mediterranean diet is important in the metabolic control processes of T2DM with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant compounds, glucagon-like peptide agonist compounds, and intestinal microbiota changes. Nutrition plays a critical role in preventing and improving CVD outcomes in patients with T2DM. Dietary modulations should be planned considering individual differences in responses to dietary composition and nutritional changes, personal preferences, eating behaviors and gut microbiota differences.\n",
            "ID: 38767746, Title: Food Insecurity and Hypoglycemia among Older Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Treated with Insulin or Sulfonylureas: The Diabetes & Aging Study., Abstract: Severe hypoglycemia is a serious adverse drug event associated with hypoglycemia-prone medications; older patients with diabetes are particularly at high risk. Economic food insecurity (food insecurity due to financial limitations) is a known risk factor for hypoglycemia; however, less is known about physical food insecurity (due to difficulty cooking or shopping for food), which may increase with age, and its association with hypoglycemia. Study associations between food insecurity and severe hypoglycemia. Survey based cross-sectional study. Survey responses were collected in 2019 from 1,164 older (≥ 65 years) patients with type 2 diabetes treated with insulin or sulfonylureas. Risk ratios (RR) for economic and physical food insecurity associated with self-reported severe hypoglycemia (low blood glucose requiring assistance) adjusted for age, financial strain, HbA1c, Charlson comorbidity score and frailty. Self-reported reasons for hypoglycemia endorsed by respondents. Food insecurity was reported by 12.3% of the respondents; of whom 38.4% reported economic food insecurity only, 21.1% physical food insecurity only and 40.5% both. Economic food insecurity and physical food insecurity were strongly associated with severe hypoglycemia (RR = 4.3; p = 0.02 and RR = 4.4; p = 0.002, respectively). Missed meals (\"skipped meals, not eating enough or waiting too long to eat\") was the dominant reason (77.5%) given for hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia prevention efforts among older patients with diabetes using hypoglycemia-prone medications should address food insecurity. Standard food insecurity questions, which are used to identify economic food insecurity, will fail to identify patients who have physical food insecurity only.\n",
            "ID: 38767740, Title: Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease and Ethnicity: Lessons Learned from the Arab Population in Israel., Abstract: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common liver disease. We aimed to investigate the potential similarities and differences regarding the disease among Arabs and Jews. Retrospective study included all patients older than 18 years with NAFLD diagnosis according to ICD-10 codes. Data regarding demographics, comorbidities, and outcomes were retrieved using the MdClone platform from \"Clalit\" in Israel. Data concerning 34,090 Arab patients and 173,500 Jewish patients with NAFLD were included. Arab patients were significantly younger at diagnosis (35.0 ± 13 years vs. 43.6 ± 15 years, p < 0.001) and had higher rates of obesity and diabetes mellitus (69.5% vs. 56.5% and 27.0% vs. 22.7%, p < 0.001, respectively). Arab patients had higher rates of cirrhosis and portal hypertension-related complications (2.5% vs. 2.0%, p < 0.001), esophageal varices (0.9% vs. 0.5%, p < 0.001), spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (0.3% vs. 0.1%, p < 0.001), and hepatorenal syndrome (0.3% vs. 0.1%, p < 0.001). There was no significant difference in the prevalence of hepatocellular carcinoma between study groups (0.4% vs. 0.5%, p = 0.156). Liver transplantation was performed in 0.2% of Arab NAFLD patients compared to 0.07% of Jewish NAFLD patients (p < 0.001). Lower rates of all-cause mortality were found among the Arab NAFLD patients versus Jewish NAFLD patients (7.7% versus 11.5%, p < 0.001). According to the Cox regression model, Arab ethnicity is a risk factor for death with OR of 1.36. Significant differences regarding comorbidities, complications, liver transplantations rates, and all-cause mortality were found among NAFLD patients of different ethnicities, hence specific population need specific consideration in prevention, early diagnosis and follow up.\n",
            "ID: 38767687, Title: High body mass index and triglyceride levels at health checkups increase the risk of new-onset chronic kidney disease and worsening renal function: the TAMA MED Project-CKD., Abstract: Health checkups are important in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), which is not easily accompanied by subjective symptoms. CKD can be caused or aggravated by factors that have not yet been identified. This retrospective cohort study included 7 483 patients who underwent specific annual health checkups at a medical institution in Tama City, did not have CKD in 2012, and continued to undergo checkups (aged 40-74 years). We examined the risk factors for new-onset CKD and 1.5-fold increase in serum creatinine levels among laboratory values from 2012 to 2020. Age, body mass index (BMI), triglyceride levels, atrial fibrillation, and medication for hypertension (HT) and diabetes mellitus were independent risk factors for proteinuria, whereas current smoking, BMI, systolic blood pressure (SBP), and medication for HT were independent risk factors for estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>. SBP, triglyceride levels and medication for HT were risk factors for a 1.5-fold increase in serum creatinine levels during course of the study. The cut-off values of BMI for eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> were 22.2 (men 24.7, women 22.1) kg/m<sup>2</sup> and fasting triglyceride levels for a 1.5-fold increase in serum creatinine level were 171 (men 247, women 170) mg/dL, respectively. Health checkups provide information to prevent new-onset CKD and worsening of renal function. It is necessary to increase the rate of health checkups and visits to medical institutions after health checkups as well as to use these results for health guidance.\n",
            "ID: 38767675, Title: Open questions on basal insulin therapy in T2D: a Delphi consensus., Abstract: The revolution in the therapeutic approach to type 2 diabetes (T2D) requires a rethinking of the positioning of basal insulin (BI) therapy. Given the considerable number of open questions, a group of experts was convened with the aim of providing, through a Delphi consensus method, practical guidance for doctors. A group of 6 experts developed a series of 29 statements on: the role of metabolic control in light of the most recent guidelines; BI intensification strategies: (1) add-on versus switch; (2) inertia in starting and titrating; (3) free versus fixed ratio combination; basal-bolus intensification and de-intensification strategies; second generation analogues of BI (2BI). A panel of 31 diabetologists, by accessing a dedicated website, assigned each statement a relevance score on a 9-point scale. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method was adopted to assess the existence of disagreement among participants. Panelists showed agreement for all 29 statements, of which 26 were considered relevant, one was considered not relevant and two were of uncertain relevance. Panelists agreed that the availability of new classes of drugs often allows the postponement of BI and the simplification of therapy. It remains essential to promptly initiate and titrate BI when required. BI should always, unless contraindicated, be started in addition to, and not as a replacement, for ongoing treatments with cardiorenal benefits. 2BIs should be preferred for their pharmacological profile, greater ease of self-titration and flexibility of administration. In a continuously evolving scenario, BI therapy still represents an important option in the management of T2D patients.\n",
            "ID: 38767674, Title: Assessment of genetic and clinical factors in T2D susceptibility among patients with hypertension., Abstract: Hypertension (HTN) and Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) often coexist, therefore understanding the relationship between both diseases is imperative to guide targeted prevention/therapy. This study aims to explore the relationship between HTN and T2D using genome-wide association study (GWAS) analysis and biochemical data to understand the implication of both clinical and genetic factors in these pathologies. A total of 2,876 patients were enrolled. Using GWAS and biochemical data, patients with both T2D and HTN were compared to patients with only HTN. Specificity was confirmed by testing the detected genetic variants for associations with HTN development in T2D patients, or with HTN in healthy subjects. Regression models were applied to examine the association of T2D in patients with HTN with cardiovascular risk factors. Replication was performed using UK Biobank dataset with 31,170 subjects. Data showed that females with HTN are at higher risk of developing T2D due to dyslipidemia, while males faced higher risk due to high BMI (body mass index) and family history of T2D. GWAS identified Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) linked to T2D in patients with HTN. Notably, rs7865889, rs7756992, and rs10896290 were positively associated with T2D, whereas rs12737517 yielded negative association. Three SNPs were replicated in the UK Biobank (rs10896290, rs7865889, and rs7756992). Incorporating clinical and genetic screening into risk assessment is important for the detection and prevention of T2D in patients with HTN. The detected SNPs (rs7865889, rs12737517, and rs10896290), especially the protective SNP (rs12737517), provide an opportunity for better diagnosis, prevention, and therapy of patients with T2D and HTN.\n",
            "ID: 38767646, Title: Characteristics and quality of clinical practice guidelines for diabetic kidney disease: a systematic review., Abstract: To assess the quality of Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) in the context of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) and determine whether any factors affect the quality. We searched eight databases along with five international and national organizations to develop or archive guidelines from their inception to July 2023, with an additional search of medlive.cn. And the authoritative organizations related to nephrology. CPGs and consensus statements created using direct differential diagnosis or therapy for DKD were included without language restrictions. Their quality was evaluated by four reviewers using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation Ⅱ (AGREE Ⅱ) instrument. Along with the item and domain scores, the guideline was also allocated an overall quality score, which ranged from 1 (lowest possible quality) to 7 (highest possible quality). Moreover, an overall recommendation for use was also assigned (\"recommended\", \"recommended with modifications\" or \"not recommended\"). A total of 16 CPGs were included, of which 14 were from Asia and the remaining two from Europe. These two CPGs were updated in the third version. Six CPGs were recommended for use because their primary domains scored in the medium or high category. Furthermore, five CPGs were recommended with modifications as the stakeholder involvement, applicability, and editorial independence domains were evaluated as low categories. In all domains, the lowest average score was for rigour of development (33%), followed by application (36%), and stakeholder involvement (51%). The highest average score was for scope and purpose (79%), followed by clarity of presentation (75%). None of the CPGs considered the patient's viewpoint, and six of 16 CPGs did not use any grading system to translate the evidence into recommendations. Additionally, only three of 16 CPGs shared search strategy, and eight of 16 CPGs did not declare a funding source. According to the AGREE II evaluation, more than one in four CPGs for DKD had poor methodological quality. Enhanced efforts are needed to advance the rigour of development, application, and editorial independence of DKD guideline panels for most guidelines. Stakeholders, CPG developers, and CPG users should consider methodological quality while choosing CPGs, and interpret and implement their issued suggestions.\n",

We enrolled 435 patients with DKD, who were not undergoing dialysis, admitted to the Department of Nephrology, First Medical Center, Chinese PLA General Hospital from April 2020 to August 2021. Analysis of their TCM syndromes and related factors was carried out. The 435 patients included 109, 117, 86, and 123 chronic kidney disease (CKD) 1-2, CKD3, CKD4, and CKD5 cases, respectively. With the progression of CKD1-5, the proportion of <i>Yin</i> deficiency and dry heat syndrome, and that of <i>Qi</i> and <i>Yin</i> deficiency syndrome showed a downward trend, whereas the proportion of spleen-kidney <i>Yang</i> deficiency, blood deficiency, blood stasis, water stagnation, and phlegm turbidity syndromes showed an upward trend; the differences were statistically significant (<i>P</i> < 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that <i>Yin</i> deficiency and dry heat syndrome was positively correlated with hemoglobin [odds ratio (<i>OR</i>) = 1.022, <i>P</i> = 0.005], albumin (<i>OR</i> = 1.058, <i>P =</i> 0.006), and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (<i>OR</i> = 1.020, <i>P <</i> 0.001) but negatively correlated with male sex (<i>OR</i> = 0.277, <i>P =</i> 0.004). <i>Qi</i> and <i>Yin</i> deficiency syndrome was positively correlated with albumin (<i>OR</i> = 1.056, <i>P</i> < 0.001) and eGFR (<i>OR</i> = 1.008, <i>P</i> = 0.022) but negatively correlated with age (<i>OR</i> = 0.977, <i>P</i> = 0.023). Liver-kidney <i>Yin</i> deficiency syndrome was positively correlated with age (<i>OR</i> = 1.028, <i>P =</i> 0.021) and glycosylated hemoglobin (<i>OR</i> = 1.223, <i>P =</i> 0.007) but negatively correlated with total cholesterol (<i>OR</i> = 0.792, <i>P</i> = 0.006). Spleen-kidney <i>Yang</i> deficiency syndrome was negatively correlated with hemoglobin (<i>OR</i> = 0.977, <i>P</i> < 0.001), albumin (<i>OR</i> = 0.891, <i>P</i> < 0.001), and eGFR (<i>OR</i> = 0.978, <i>P</i> < 0.001) but positively correlated with high density lipoprotein (<i>OR</i> = 3.376, <i>P</i> = 0.001). With CKD1-5 progression, TCM syndromes changed from <i>Yin</i> deficiency and dry heat syndrome to syndrome of deficiency of both <i>Qi</i> and <i>Yin</i>, liver-kidney <i>Yin</i>, and spleen-kidney <i>Yang</i> deficiency syndromes. TCM syndromes were correlated with laboratory test results.\n",

In this study, HH plant was preliminary analyzed for phytochemical screening and then tested for its antioxidant, anti-α-amylase, and anti-AChE efficiency <i>via</i> standard procedures. Phytochemical analysis shows the existence of different compounds; while Coumarins and quinones were absent. The total phenolic, flavonoid, and tannins content were found to be (78.52 ± 0.69) mg GAE/g, (2.01 ± 0.04) mg RUE/g, and (58.12 ± 0.23) mg TAE/g of plant extract respectively. 28.02% ± 0.02% alkaloid and 2.02% ± 0.05% saponins were present in the HH extract. The HH extract showed the anti-oxidant property with IC50 (50% inhibition) of (151.01 ± 0.13) (HH), (79.01 ± 0.04) (Ascorbic acid) for ferric reducing, (91.48 ± 0.13) (HH), (48.02 ± 0.11) (Ascorbic acid) against Ammonium molybdenum, (156.02 ± 0.31) (HH), (52.38 ± 0.21) (Ascorbic acid) against DPPH, 136.01 ± 0.21 (HH), 52.02± 0.31 (Ascorbic acid) against H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, and 154.12 ± 0.03 (HH), (40.05 ± 0.15) (Ascorbic acid) μg/mL against ABTS respectively. Statistical analysis indicated that HH caused a competitive type of inhibition of α-amylase (<i>V<sub>max</sub></i> remained constant and Km increases from 10.65 to 84.37%) while Glucophage caused the un-competitive type of inhibition i-e both Km and <i>V<sub>max</sub></i> decreased from 40.49 to 69.15% and 38.86 to 69.61% respectively. The <i>K<sub>i</sub></i>, (inhibition constant); <i>K<sub>I</sub></i>, (dissociation constant), <i>K<sub>m</sub></i>, (Michaelis-Menten constant), and IC50 were found to be 62, 364, 68.1, and 38.08 ± 0.22 for HH and 12, 101.05, 195, 34.01 ± 0.21 for Glucophage. Similarly, HH causes an anon-competitive type of inhibition of AChE i-e Km remains constant while <i>V<sub>max</sub></i> decreases from 60.5% to 74.1%. The calculated <i>K<sub>i</sub></i>, <i>K<sub>I</sub></i>, <i>K<sub>m</sub></i>, and IC50 were found to be 32, 36.2, 0.05, and 18.117 ± 0.018.

            "ID: 38767572, Title: Proteasome gene expression is controlled by coordinated functions of multiple transcription factors., Abstract: Proteasome activity is crucial for cellular integrity, but how tissues adjust proteasome content in response to catabolic stimuli is uncertain. Here, we demonstrate that transcriptional coordination by multiple transcription factors is required to increase proteasome content and activate proteolysis in catabolic states. Using denervated mouse muscle as a model system for accelerated proteolysis in vivo, we reveal that a two-phase transcriptional program activates genes encoding proteasome subunits and assembly chaperones to boost an increase in proteasome content. Initially, gene induction is necessary to maintain basal proteasome levels, and in a more delayed phase (7-10 days after denervation), it stimulates proteasome assembly to meet cellular demand for excessive proteolysis. Intriguingly, the transcription factors PAX4 and α-PALNRF-1 control the expression of proteasome among other genes in a combinatorial manner, driving cellular adaptation to muscle denervation. Consequently, PAX4 and α-PALNRF-1 represent new therapeutic targets to inhibit proteolysis in catabolic diseases (e.g., type-2 diabetes, cancer).\n",
            "ID: 38767441, Title: Efficacy and Safety of Sirolimus-Eluting Stent with Biodegradable Polymer Ultimaster™ in Unselected Korean Population: A Multicenter, Prospective, Observational Study From Korean Multicenter Ultimaster Registry., Abstract: Ultimaster™, a third-generation sirolimus-eluting stent using biodegradable polymer, has been introduced to overcome long term adverse vascular events, such as restenosis or stent thrombosis. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the 12-month clinical outcomes of Ultimaster™ stents in Korean patients with coronary artery disease. This study is a multicenter, prospective, observational registry across 12 hospitals. To reflect real-world clinical evidence, non-selective subtypes of patients and lesions were included in this study. The study end point was target lesion failure (TLF) (the composite of cardiac death, target vessel myocardial infarction [MI], and target lesion revascularization [TLR]) at 12-month clinical follow up. A total of 576 patients were enrolled between November 2016 and May 2021. Most of the patients were male (76.5%), with a mean age of 66.0±11.2 years. Among the included patients, 40.1% had diabetes mellitus (DM) and 67.9% had acute coronary syndrome (ACS). At 12 months, the incidence of TLF was 4.1%. The incidence of cardiac death was 1.5%, MI was 1.0%, TLR was 2.7%, and stent thrombosis was 0.6%. In subgroup analysis based on the presence of ACS, DM, hypertension, dyslipidemia, or bifurcation, there were no major differences in the incidence of the primary endpoint. The present registry shows that Ultimaster™ stent is safe and effective for routine real-world clinical practice in non-selective Korean patients, having a low rate of adverse events at least up to 12 months.\n",
            "ID: 38767438, Title: Augmenter of liver regeneration knockout aggravates tubular ferroptosis and macrophage activation by regulating carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1A-induced lipid metabolism in diabetic nephropathy., Abstract: Ferroptosis is a novel type of programmed cell death that performs a critical function in diabetic nephropathy (DN). Augmenter of liver regeneration (ALR) exists in the inner membrane of mitochondria, and inhibits inflammation, apoptosis, and oxidative stress in acute kidney injury; however, its role in DN remains unexplored. Here, we aimed to identify the role of ALR in ferroptosis induction and macrophage activation in DN. The expression of ALR was examined in DN patients, db/db DN mice, and HK-2 cells treated with high glucose (HG). The effects of ALR on ferroptosis and macrophage activation were investigated with ALR conditional knockout, lentivirus transfection, transmission electron microscopy, qRT-PCR and western blotting assay. Mass spectrometry and rescue experiments were conducted to determine the mechanism of ALR. ALR expression was reduced in the kidney tissues of DN patients and mice, serum of DN patients, and HG-HK-2 cells. Moreover, the inhibition of ALR promoted ferroptosis, macrophage activation, and DN progression. Mechanistically, ALR can directly bind to carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1A (CPT1A), the key rate-limiting enzyme of fatty acid oxidation (FAO), and inhibit the expression of CPT1A to regulate lipid metabolism involving FAO and lipid droplet-mitochondrial coupling in DN. Taken together, our findings revealed a crucial protective role of ALR in ferroptosis induction and macrophage activation in DN and identified it as an alternative diagnostic marker and therapeutic target for DN.\n",
            "ID: 38767382, Title: Building Trustworthy Generative Artificial Intelligence for Diabetes Care and Limb Preservation: A Medical Knowledge Extraction Case., Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer significant potential in medical information extraction but carry risks of generating incorrect information. This study aims to develop and validate a retriever-augmented generation (RAG) model that provides accurate medical knowledge about diabetes and diabetic foot care to laypersons with an eighth-grade literacy level. Improving health literacy through patient education is paramount to addressing the problem of limb loss in the diabetic population. In addition to affecting patient well-being through improved outcomes, improved physician well-being is an important outcome of a self-management model for patient health education. We used an RAG architecture and built a question-and-answer artificial intelligence (AI) model to extract knowledge in response to questions pertaining to diabetes and diabetic foot care. We utilized GPT-4 by OpenAI, with Pinecone as a vector database. The NIH National Standards for Diabetes Self-Management Education served as the basis for our knowledge base. The model's outputs were validated through expert review against established guidelines and literature. Fifty-eight keywords were used to select 295 articles and the model was tested against 175 questions across topics. The study demonstrated that with appropriate content volume and few-shot learning prompts, the RAG model achieved 98% accuracy, confirming its capability to offer user-friendly and comprehensible medical information. The RAG model represents a promising tool for delivering reliable medical knowledge to the public which can be used for self-education and self-management for diabetes, highlighting the importance of content validation and innovative prompt engineering in AI applications.\n",
            "ID: 38767365, Title: Isolation of Nuclei from Human Intermuscular Adipose Tissue and Downstream Single-Nuclei RNA Sequencing., Abstract: Intermuscular adipose tissue (IMAT) is a relatively understudied adipose depot located between muscle fibers. IMAT content increases with age and BMI and is associated with metabolic and muscle degenerative diseases; however, an understanding of the biological properties of IMAT and its interplay with the surrounding muscle fibers is severely lacking. In recent years, single-cell and nuclei RNA sequencing have provided us with cell type-specific atlases of several human tissues. However, the cellular composition of human IMAT remains largely unexplored due to the inherent challenges of its accessibility from biopsy collection in humans. In addition to the limited amount of tissue collected, the processing of human IMAT is complicated due to its proximity to skeletal muscle tissue and fascia. The lipid-laden nature of the adipocytes makes it incompatible with single-cell isolation. Hence, single nuclei RNA sequencing is optimal for obtaining high-dimensional transcriptomics at single-cell resolution and provides the potential to uncover the biology of this depot, including the exact cellular composition of IMAT. Here, we present a detailed protocol for nuclei isolation and library preparation of frozen human IMAT for single nuclei RNA sequencing. This protocol allows for the profiling of thousands of nuclei using a droplet-based approach, thus providing the capacity to detect rare and low-abundant cell types.\n",
            "ID: 38767350, Title: Changes in the type 2 diabetes gut mycobiome associate with metformin treatment across populations., Abstract: The human gut teems with a diverse ecosystem of microbes, yet non-bacterial portions of that community are overlooked in studies of metabolic diseases firmly linked to gut bacteria. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) is associated with compositional shifts in the gut bacterial microbiome and the mycobiome, the fungal portion of the microbiome. However, whether T2D and/or metformin treatment underpins fungal community changes is unresolved. To differentiate these effects, we curated a gut mycobiome cohort spanning 1,000 human samples across five countries and validated our findings in a murine experimental model. We use Bayesian multinomial logistic normal models to show that T2D and metformin both associate with shifts in the relative abundance of distinct gut fungi. T2D is associated with shifts in the Saccharomycetes and Sordariomycetes fungal classes, while the genera <i>Fusarium</i> and <i>Tetrapisipora</i> most consistently associate with metformin treatment. We confirmed the impact of metformin on individual gut fungi by administering metformin to healthy mice. Thus, metformin and T2D account for subtle, but significant and distinct variation in the gut mycobiome across human populations. This work highlights for the first time that metformin can confound associations of gut fungi with T2D and warrants the need to consider pharmaceutical interventions in investigations of linkages between metabolic diseases and gut microbial inhabitants. This is the largest to-date multi-country cohort characterizing the human gut mycobiome, and the first to investigate potential perturbations in gut fungi from oral pharmaceutical treatment. We demonstrate the reproducible effects of metformin treatment on the human and murine gut mycobiome and highlight a need to consider metformin as a confounding factor in investigations between type 2 diabetes mellitus and the gut microbial ecosystem.\n",
            "ID: 38767331, Title: Decoding the complexity of delayed wound healing following <i>Enterococcus faecalis</i> infection., Abstract: Wound infections are highly prevalent and can lead to delayed or failed healing, causing significant morbidity and adverse economic impacts. These infections occur in various contexts, including diabetic foot ulcers, burns, and surgical sites. <i>Enterococcus faecalis</i> is often found in persistent non-healing wounds, but its contribution to chronic wounds remains understudied. To address this, we employed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on infected wounds in comparison to uninfected wounds in a mouse model. Examining over 23,000 cells, we created a comprehensive single-cell atlas that captures the cellular and transcriptomic landscape of these wounds. Our analysis revealed unique transcriptional and metabolic alterations in infected wounds, elucidating the distinct molecular changes associated with bacterial infection compared to the normal wound healing process. We identified dysregulated keratinocyte and fibroblast transcriptomes in response to infection, jointly contributing to an anti-inflammatory environment. Notably, <i>E. faecalis</i> infection prompted a premature, incomplete epithelial-mesenchymal transition in keratinocytes. Additionally, <i>E. faecalis</i> infection modulated M2-like macrophage polarization by inhibiting pro-inflammatory resolution in vitro, in vivo, and in our scRNA-seq atlas. Furthermore, we discovered macrophage crosstalk with neutrophils, which regulates chemokine signaling pathways, while promoting anti-inflammatory interactions with endothelial cells. Overall, our findings offer new insights into the immunosuppressive role of <i>E. faecalis</i> in wound infections.\n",

Mobile health (mHealth)-based lifestyle interventions have been shown to be effective in improving glycemic control of these women. The aim of the study was to evaluate the influence of mHealth-based lifestyle interventions on symptoms of anxiety and depression in women with GDM. A systematic review and meta-analysis or randomized controlled trials. Clinical or community-based settings. Nine studies involving 1,168 pregnant women with GDM were included. mHealth-based lifestyle interventions. Symptoms of anxiety and depression quantitatively analyzed in clinical scales. A systematic literature search was performed in electronic databases, including PubMed, Cochrane library, Embase, Web of Science, Wanfang, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure to obtain relevant randomized controlled studies. A random-effects model was used to pool the results by incorporating the impact of the potential heterogeneity. Findings revealed that when compared to usual care, women who received mHealth-based lifestyle interventions had significant improvements in symptoms of anxiety (standardized mean difference [SMD]: -0.55, 95% CI [-0.77, -0.33], <i>p</i> < .001; <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 67%) and depression (SMD: -0.51, [-0.72, -0.29], <i>p</i> < .001; <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 65%). Sensitivity analyses by excluding one study at a time showed consistent results. Subgroup analyses showed similar results in mHealth achieved by phone, websites, and applications, in mHealth targeting diet and exercise with and without psychological support, in mHealth lead by nurse with and without other clinical specialists, and in studies with different evaluating tools for anxiety and depression. mHealth-based lifestyle interventions could significantly improve the symptoms of anxiety and depression in women with GDM.\n",
            "ID: 38767210, Title: T cells in obesity-associated inflammation: The devil is in the details., Abstract: Obesity presents a significant health challenge, affecting 41% of adults and 19.7% of children in the United States. One of the associated health challenges of obesity is chronic low-grade inflammation. In both mice and humans, T cells in circulation and in the adipose tissue play a pivotal role in obesity-associated inflammation. Changes in the numbers and frequency of specific CD4<sup>+</sup> Th subsets and their contribution to inflammation through cytokine production indicate declining metabolic health, that is, insulin resistance and T2D. While some Th subset alterations are consistent between mice and humans with obesity, some changes mainly characterize male mice, whereas female mice often resist obesity and inflammation. However, protection from obesity and inflammation is not observed in human females, who can develop obesity-related T-cell inflammation akin to males. The decline in female sex hormones after menopause is also implicated in promoting obesity and inflammation. Age is a second underappreciated factor for defining and regulating obesity-associated inflammation toward translating basic science findings to the clinic. Weight loss in mice and humans, in parallel with these other factors, does not resolve obesity-associated inflammation. Instead, inflammation persists amid modest changes in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell frequencies, highlighting the need for further research into resolving changes in T-cell function after weight loss. How lingering inflammation after weight loss affecting the common struggle to maintain lower weight is unknown. Semaglutide, a newly popular pharmaceutical used for treating T2D and reversing obesity, holds promise for alleviating obesity-associated health complications, yet its impact on T-cell-mediated inflammation remains unexplored. Further work in this area could significantly contribute to the scientific understanding of the impacts of weight loss and sex/hormones in obesity and obesity-associated metabolic decline.\n",

Lp(a) plays a role in atherogenic, pro-thrombotic, and antifibrinolytic processes. Elevated plasma Lp(a) is a strong independent risk factor for the development and progression of atherosclerotic disease. The association between lipoproteins and IS is more complex than that reported for cardiovascular diseases, with inconsistent and contradictory results from epidemiological studies. 231 patients with acute IS (defined as cases) and 163 age- and sex-matched control subjects were included in this prospective case-control study. Demographic and clinical variables (i.e. age, sex, smoking, presence of chronic diseases and concomitant medication) and laboratory data (i.e. concentrations of total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, triglycerides, Lp(a), apolipoprotein A1, apolipoprotein B) were recorded. The mean age and the percentage of men did not significantly differ between groups. Compared to controls, there was a significantly higher percentage of cases reported with concomitant diseases: diabetes mellitus, myocardial infarction, ischaemic heart disease, peripheral arterial disease, and atrial fibrillation. The study showed a significantly higher serum Lp(a) concentration in cases than in control subjects (81.81 nmol/L [c.32.7 mg/dL] vs. 59.75 nmol/L [c.23.9 mg/dL]; p = 0.036) and found an association between Lp(a) levels stratified by quartiles and the risk for ischaemic stroke (Q1 [Lp(a) < 13 nmol/L] vs. Q4 [Lp(a) > 117 nmol/L]: OR 2.23; 95% CI 1.23-4.03; p = 0.008). A subgroup analysis based on the TOAST classification of IS also showed a significant association between Lp(a) value of more than 75 nmol/L (30 mg/dL) and the risk of large-artery atherosclerosis stroke compared to the controls (OR 2.4; 95% CI 1.39-3.93; p = 0.001), as well as a statistically non-significant association with other subtypes of IS. The influence of Lp(a) remained significant even after adjusting for established risk factors for IS (OR 1.99; 95% CI 1.05-3.76; p = 0.04; respectively for the large-artery atherosclerotic subtype: OR 2.54; 95% CI 1.39-4.67; p = 0.003). We found that Lp(a) is an independent risk factor for ischaemic stroke, and for the large-artery atherosclerotic subtype of ischaemic stroke.\n",

This retrospective, comparative study included patients with macular edema due to diabetic retinopathy (DME) or vein occlusion who were treated with intravitreal injections of either steroids (triamcinolone acetonide or dexamethasone sustained release implant) or anti-vascular endothelial growth factor antibodies (VEGF). The central retinal thickness (CRT) and the best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) were measured 1 day after the injection and compared with immediate pre-injection values. There were 79 eyes (57 patients) including 51 eyes with DME, 18 with branch retinal vein occlusion edema (BRVO-ME), and 10 eyes with central retinal vein occlusion edema (CRVO-ME). The intravitreal agents were triamcinolone acetonide (TA)(<i>n</i> = 15), dexamethasone sustained release implant (DEX)(<i>n</i> = 22), ranibizumab (<i>n</i> = 19), and bevacizumab (<i>n</i> = 23). Statistically significant improvement in CRT was seen in all injection groups (<i>p</i> < 0.05) while improvement in mean BCVA was significant only in the TA group (<i>p</i> = 0.009). The mean change in CRT was maximum with steroids than with anti-VEGFs; viz. 159.47 µ in TA, 115.45 µ in DEX, 86.10 µ in ranibizumab, and 78.78 µ in bevacizumab group. Least amount of change was noted in the spongy type of macular edema (18.73 µ) while improvement in mean BCVA was statistically significant only in the cystoid group (<i>p</i> = 0.01). Comparatively, steroid agents showed better immediate response to therapy than anti-VEGFs. Maximum reduction in central retinal thickness was seen following triamcinolone acetonide injection. Cystoid edema showed better immediate response than spongy retinal thickening.\n",
            "ID: 38767128, Title: Severe dawn phenomenon predicts long-term risk of all-cause mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes., Abstract: The dawn phenomenon (DP) is an abnormal early morning blood glucose rise without nocturnal hypoglycaemia, which can be more easily and precisely assessed with continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). This prospective study aimed to explore the association between DP and the risk of all-cause mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes. A total of 5542 adult inpatients with type 2 diabetes in a single centre were analysed. The magnitude of DP (ΔG) was defined as the increment in the CGM-determined glucose value from nocturnal nadir (after 24:00) to prebreakfast. Participants were stratified into four groups by ΔG: ≤1.11, 1.12-3.33, 3.34-5.55, and >5.55 mmol/L. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to evaluate the impact of DP on all-cause mortality risk. During a median follow-up of 9.4 years, 1083 deaths were identified. The restricted cubic spline revealed a nonlinear (p for nonlinearity = 0.002) relationship between ΔG and the risk of all-cause mortality. A multivariate-adjusted Cox regression model including glycated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) showed that ΔG > 5.55 mmol/L was associated with 30% (95% CI, 1.01-1.66) higher risk of all-cause mortality, as compared with ΔG 1.12-3.33 mmol/L. Higher ΔG is significantly related to an increased risk of all-cause mortality in type 2 diabetes, suggesting that severe DP should be given more attention as a part of glucose management to reduce the risk of long-term adverse outcomes.\n",

We conducted a retrospective analysis of 713 autoantibody-positive participants who developed type 1 diabetes in the TrialNet Pathway to Prevention Study who had T1DExomeChip data. We evaluated the relationships of 16 known SNPs and T1D-GRS2 with area under the curve (AUC) C-peptide levels during oral glucose tolerance tests conducted in the 9 months before diagnosis. Higher T1D-GRS2 was associated with lower C-peptide AUC in the 9 months before diagnosis in univariate (β=-0.06, P<0.0001) and multivariate (β=-0.03, P=0.005) analyses. Participants with the JAZF1 rs864745 T allele had lower C-peptide AUC in both univariate (β=-0.11, P=0.002) and multivariate (β=-0.06, P=0.018) analyses. The type 2 diabetes-associated JAZF1 rs864745 T allele and higher T1D-GRS2 are associated with lower C-peptide AUC prior to diagnosis of type 1 diabetes, with implications for the design of prevention trials.\n",

Using a PCOS-like mouse model, it is demonstrated that hyperandrogenism affects immune cell populations in reproductive, metabolic, and immunological tissues differently in a site-specific manner. Co-treatment with an androgen receptor antagonist prevents most of these alterations, demonstrating that these effects are mediated through androgen receptor activation. Dihydrotestosterone (DHT)-exposed mice displayed a drastically reduced eosinophil population in the uterus and visceral adipose tissue (VAT). A higher frequency of natural killer (NK) cells and elevated levels of IFN-γ and TNF-α are seen in uteri of androgen-exposed mice, while NK cells in VAT and spleen displayed a higher expression level of CD69, a marker of activation or tissue residency. Distinct alterations of macrophages in the uterus, ovaries, and VAT are also found in DHT-exposed mice and can potentially be linked to PCOS-like traits of the model. Indeed, androgen-exposed mice are insulin-resistant, albeit unaltered fat mass. Collectively, it is demonstrated that hyperandrogenism causes tissue-specific alterations of immune cells in reproductive organs and VAT, which can have considerable implications on tissue function and contribute to the reduced fertility and metabolic comorbidities associated with PCOS.\n",

Its effectiveness and tolerability as an addition to metformin, DPP4 inhibitor and insulin treatment in type 2 diabetic patients will be examined in this research. Participants with type 2 diabetes from poor socio-economic backgrounds had HbA1c values ≥8.5% when using Insulin+Metformin+DPP-4 inhibitors. They received 10mg Empagliflozin daily for 12 weeks (n=143). The main outcome was change in HbA1c at 12<sup>th</sup> week from baseline. Secondary outcomes were baseline weight and week 12 FPG. Adjusted mean (SE) HbA1c increases at week 12 were: Mean ± SD 10.38 (6.8-17.0) vs. Mean±SD 9.05±1.77 (5.60-16.0) with empagliflozin 10mg. When added to the regimen, empagliflozin significantly reduced FPG, systolic and diastolic blood pressure. The mean (SE) BMI increases from baseline were 31.28±5.89 (16.0-66.0) and 29.73±5.47 (3.0-46.0) with 10mg empagliflozin. Two individuals experienced urinary tract infections as AEs, but no genital infections. Adding empagliflozin 10mg daily to metformin+DPP4 inhibitor+insulin improved glycemic control, body weight and blood pressure for 12 weeks. The intervention was well-tolerated, highlighting empagliflozin's therapeutic potential.\n",
            "ID: 38767101, Title: Effects of dapagliflozin against streptozotocin and isoproterenol-induced heart failure via investigating NLRP3 and PPAR-γ signaling., Abstract: Heart failure is a condition in which the heart's one or both ventricles are unable to either receive an adequate amount of blood or eject an adequate amount of blood. Diabetes is considered one of the major risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. The current research is designed to evaluate the cardioprotective effects of dapagliflozin in streptozotocin and isoproterenol-induced comorbid rats. The COX-2, TNF-α, NF-КB, NLRP3, PPAR-γ, CKMB, TROP-I, AR, GP and SGLT were docked against dapagliflozin, propranolol and metformin. Dapagliflozin restored adequate blood flow and halted myofibril damage. Moreover, it's evident from this study that dapagliflozin significantly decreased serum concentration of various blood markers, decreased relative growth rate and QT interval prolongation, as compared to the negative control group. However, it improved the ventricular ejection fraction in rats of the treatment group. The GST, GSH and CAT levels were increased, as compared to normal. On the contrary, a decrease in LPO concentrations was observed. Evaluation of the coronal section of heart tissues showed the anti-inflammatory expressions evaluated through H & E staining and immunohistochemical techniques and with ELISA and PCR. In a nutshell, dapagliflozin reverses myocardial necrosis and apoptosis.\n",

The diabetic condition was evaluated using Streptozotocin's oral glucose tolerance test, diabetes-alloxan and diabetes-models. Antiulcer activities were observed in rats where gastric ulcers were either caused by oral administration of ethanol, or pyloric ligation. Standards include ranitidine, glibenclamide and sucralfate. In all models, the blood glucose levels of animals treated with the test extract were found to be significantly lower compared to diabetic care. Similarly, in all models, the ulcer index in the animals treated with the test extract was found to be significantly lower relative to the animals under vehicle supervision. Our findings say T. Spathacea extract has essential anti-diabetic properties, as well as antiulcer properties.\n",
            "ID: 38767097, Title: Evaluation of the combination of black rice bran ethanol extract and glimepiride in reducing blood glucose and protecting kidney, liver and pancreatic cells., Abstract: Long-lasting hyperglycemia can potentially cause damage to organs such as the kidneys, liver and pancreas. Glimepiride (GLIM), as a drug of choice in the treatment of diabetes mellitus (DM), has the risk of decreasing the functioning of organs such as the kidneys, liver and pancreas. Black rice bran ethanol extract (EEBRB) with antioxidant content has been shown to protect the kidney, liver and pancreas organs. The aim of this study was to establish the effect of EEBRB on lowering fasting blood glucose (FBG) and protecting several organs after GLIM administration in alloxan (ALX)-induced hyperglycemic rats. A total of 20 rats were divided into 4 groups and treated for 21 days treatments using following preparations: normal control (NC), diabetic group (DC), GLIM 1 mg/ kgBW and combination of glimepiride 1mg/kgBW and EEBRB 50 mg/KgBW (GLBR). The results showed that the GLBR was able to lower blood glucose levels back to normal (<126 mg/dL) and protect kidney, liver and pancreas cells by increasing the amount in normal cells.\n",
            "ID: 38767095, Title: Quantification of mangiferin in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rat plasma using UPLC-MS/MS: Pharmacokinetic assessment of Gentiana rhodantha extract after oral administration., Abstract: Mangiferin, a key bioactive constituent in Gentiana rhodantha, has a favorable impact on reducing blood sugar. A selective and sensitive UPLC MS/MS approach was developed for determining mangiferin in diabetic rats. Employing acetonitrile protein precipitation, chromatographic separation utilized a 2.1×50 mm, 3.5μm C<sub>18</sub> column with a mobile phase of 0.1% formic acid aqueous and 5mM ammonium acetate (A, 45%) and acetonitrile (B, 55%) at a 0.5mL min<sup>-1</sup> flow rate. Quantification, employing the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode, focused on precursor-to-product ion transitions at m/z 447.1→271.1 for baicalin m/z and 421.0→301.0 for mangiferin. Calibration curves demonstrated linearity in the 1.00~100ng/mL range, with a lower quantification limit for rat plasma set at 1.00ng/mL. Inter- and intra-day accuracies spanned -9.1% to 8.5% and mangiferin mean recovery varied from 82.3% to 86.7%. The adeptly utilized UPLC-MS/MS approach facilitated the exploration of mangiferin pharmacokinetics in diabetic rats.\n",
            "ID: 38767063, Title: Hypoparathyroidism update., Abstract: Since the release of the 2022 Second International Workshop Evaluation and Management of Hypoparathyroidism Summary Statement and Guidelines, updates and advances are now available in the cause, complications, and treatment of adult chronic hypoparathyroidism (hypoPTH). This review aims to highlight these new findings and implications to patient care. Postsurgical hypoparathyroidism remains the most common cause, immune-related hypoparathyroidism from checkpoint inhibitors is an emerging autoimmune cause. In a large retrospective cohort study of thyroidectomies, incident fracture was lower, particularly in the vertebra, in the hypoPTH cohort, compared with postthyroidectomy control group. Hypercalciuria increases risk for renal calculi in hypoPTH independent of disease duration and treatment dose. Quality of life is impaired in hypoPTH patients on conventional therapy, improvement was noted post-PTH replacement. TranCon PTH phase 3 RCT reported eucalcemia with reduced renal calcium excretion, normalization of bone turn-over markers, stable BMD and improved quality of life. HypoPTH is a chronic disease associated with significant morbidity and poor Quality of Life. Awareness of treatment targets and follow-up investigations can alleviate patient anxiety regarding over-treatment and under-treatment. Progress in long-acting PTH replacement strategies might provide accessible, feasible alternatives to conventional therapy in brittle hypoPTH patients.\n",
            "ID: 38767051, Title: A novel radiomics-based technique for identifying vulnerable coronary plaques: a follow-up study., Abstract: Previous reports have suggested that coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA)-based radiomics analysis is a potentially helpful tool for assessing vulnerable plaques. We aimed to investigate whether coronary radiomic analysis of CCTA images could identify vulnerable plaques in patients with stable angina pectoris. This retrospective study included patients initially diagnosed with stable angina pectoris. Patients were randomly divided into either the training or test dataset at an 8 : 2 ratio. Radiomics features were extracted from CCTA images. Radiomics models for predicting vulnerable plaques were developed using the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm. The model performance was assessed using the area under the curve (AUC); the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were calculated to compare the diagnostic performance using the two cohorts. A total of 158 patients were included in the analysis. The SVM radiomics model performed well in predicting vulnerable plaques, with AUC values of 0.977 and 0.875 for the training and test cohorts, respectively. With optimal cutoff values, the radiomics model showed accuracies of 0.91 and 0.882 in the training and test cohorts, respectively. Although further larger population studies are necessary, this novel CCTA radiomics model may identify vulnerable plaques in patients with stable angina pectoris.\n",

The review outlines crucial changes, including novel recommendations supported by current clinical evidence. The focus is on these developments, clarifying their importance for day-to-day clinical practice. The review encourages a synergistic approach between primary healthcare providers and cardiologists to develop comprehensive strategies for lifestyle modification and medication therapy in CCD care. Furthermore, it suggests that utilizing comprehensive risk assessment tools can refine medical decision-making, ultimately enhancing patient care and clinical outcomes.\n",
            "ID: 38766907, Title: Pembrolizumab-induced type 1 diabetes., Abstract: Immunotherapy has a crucial role in the current treatment of multiple malignancies. Albeit described as rare, new onset autoimmune diabetes is a potentially life-threatening complication of programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) inhibitors, such as pembrolizumab, and its predisposing factors and pathological mechanism are yet to be clarified. We present a case of a 72-year-old man with a high-grade bladder carcinoma undergoing pembrolizumab treatment. He had no personal or family history of diabetes mellitus but was diagnosed with primary hypothyroidism four months after starting pembrolizumab. Two years after starting pembrolizumab, he presented in the emergency department due to abdominal pain, anorexia, polydipsia, polyuria and vomiting over the preceding five days and he met criteria for severe diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Three days prior to his admission, he had received prednisolone therapy for suspected hypersensitivity related to a contrast-enhanced imaging that he performed. Prompt treatment for DKA was started, with transition to insulin basal-bolus therapy after DKA resolution, with progressive glycaemic stabilization. Further investigation revealed low C-peptide levels (0.07 ng/dL, with a fasting blood glucose of 288 mg/dL), HbA1c 9.2% and positive anti-IA2 antibodies, which allowed the diagnosis of new-onset autoimmune diabetes. Pembrolizumab was transiently suspended, and the patient resumed treatment after glycaemic profile optimization under multiple daily insulin administrations two months later. This case highlights the importance of clinical suspicion and glycaemic monitoring as an integral part of treatment protocols in patients on pembrolizumab and other immune checkpoint inhibitors. Additional research and investigation into the underlying mechanisms of this condition are necessary to identify potential screening tests for individuals at higher risk of developing DM and to guide the implementation of management and preventive strategies for ketoacidosis complication.\n",

We examined the association between APOE ɛ4 status and long-term fall- and fracture-related hospitalisation risk in older women. 1276 community-dwelling women from the Perth Longitudinal Study of Ageing Women (mean age ± SD = 75.2 ± 2.7 years) were included. At baseline, women underwent APOE genotyping and detailed phenotyping for covariates including prevalent falls and fractures, as well as health and lifestyle factors. The association between APOE ɛ4 with fall-, any fracture-, and hip fracture-related hospitalisations, obtained over 14.5 years from linked health records, were examined using multivariable-adjusted Cox-proportional hazard models. Over 14.5 years, 507 (39.7%) women experienced a fall-related hospitalisation, 360 (28.2%) women experienced a fracture-related hospitalisation, including 143 (11.2%) attributed to a hip fracture. In multivariable-adjusted models, compared to non-carriers, APOE ɛ4 carriers (n=297, 23.3%) had greater risk for a fall- (HR 1.48 95%CI 1.22-1.81), fracture- (HR 1.28, 95%CI 1.01-1.63) or hip fracture-related hospitalisation (HR 1.83 95%CI 1.29-2.61). The estimates remained similar when specific fall and fracture risk factors (fear of falling, plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D, grip strength, timed-up-and-go, hip BMD, vitamin K status, prevalent diabetes, HbA1c, cholesterol, abbreviated mental test score) were added to the multivariable model. In conclusion, APOE ɛ4 is a potential risk factor for fall- and fracture-related hospitalisation in community-dwelling older women. Screening for APOE ɛ4 could provide clinicians an opportunity to direct higher risk individuals to appropriate intervention strategies.\n",

The present review aims to narrate the clinical guidelines and therapeutic interventions for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) patients. Furthermore, the present work summarizes the ongoing phase 1/2/3 and clinical trials against T2DM. A meticulous and comprehensive literature review was performed using various databases, such as PubMed, MEDLINE, Clinical trials database (https://clinicaltrials.gov/), and Google Scholar, to include various clinical trials and therapeutic interventions against T2DM. Based on our findings, we concluded that most T2DM-associated clinical trials are interventional. Anti-diabetic therapeutics, including insulin, metformin, Dipeptidyl Peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor Agonists (GLP-1RAs), and Sodium- Glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors are frontline therapeutics being clinically investigated. Currently, the therapeutics in phase IV clinical trials are mostly SGLT-2 inhibitors, implicating their critical contribution to the clinical management of T2DM. Despite the success of T2DM treatments, a surge in innovative treatment options to reduce diabetic consequences and improve glycemic control is currently ongoing. More emphasis needs to be on exploring novel targeted drug candidates that can offer more sustained glycemic control.\n",

Diabetes, cardiovascular disorders (CVD), renal dysfunction, and ischemic stroke are the most prevalent ailments contributing to a high mortality rate worldwide. Reactive oxygen species are one of the leading factors that act as a fundamental root cause of metabolic syndrome. All of these disorders have their respective treatments, which, to some degree, sabotage the pathological worsening of the disease and an inevitable death. However, they pose a perilous health hazard to humankind. Cysteine, a functional amino acid shows promise for the prevention and treatment of metabolic disorders, such as CVD, Diabetes mellitus, renal dysfunction, and ischemic stroke. In this review, we explored whether cysteine can eradicate reactive oxygen species and subsequently prevent and treat these diseases.\n",

A qualitative Interpretive Description design was used to explore and capture the experiences of rural and remote pharmacists interacting with grey nomads who had diabetes. Data from the interviews were analysed thematically. The Pharmacy Guild of Australia was approached and through their membership rural and remote pharmacists were invited to participate in the research. Nine rural and remote pharmacists who had encounters and provided services to grey nomads with diabetes responded to be interviewed. The analysed findings established four major themes including: the influence of rural and remote locations on services; common problems encountered by the pharmacists; preparation for travel by grey nomads with diabetes; and pharmacists' preparedness to support grey nomads with diabetes. The findings of this study identified that pharmacists needed remuneration for services provided to grey nomads with diabetes. Also, further development of the My Health record and telehealth to include pharmacists would be advantageous for grey nomads who have diabetes. Pharmacists stated there was a need for further education and a continuing professional development module specifically designed for pharmacists on diabetes self-management that moved beyond medications. A pre-travel checklist for grey nomads with diabetes travelling in rural and remote Australia would benefit all stakeholders through better preparation of travellers with diabetes to self-manage, thereby reducing the demand for health services including pharmacies.\n",

Psychosocial, economic, and cultural correlates of disease have important implications for disease management but are rarely explored in India. The purpose of this study is to address psychosocial and cultural factors in diabetes management in the northeastern region of India which has a high disease burden. This study attempts to explore the psychosocial and lived experience of diabetes in the northeastern state of Meghalaya. The sample was selected from individuals attending an outpatient facility of a multi-speciality clinic. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 25 individuals (13 women and 12 men), above the age of 40 years, who had been diagnosed with diabetes for at least 6 months. The narratives were analysed using thematic analysis. Using the social cognitive framework, themes were organized in terms of a thematic map linking knowledge of diabetes to the perception of diabetes as 'a silent killer', to coping, leading to self-efficacy. However high self-efficacy, over time, may lead to complacency, disrupting health behaviours and requiring re-establishment of those behaviours. Adequate knowledge along with cognitive adaptation and self-efficacy were important constructs that contributed to behaviour change and maintenance. Elements of the cultural context were observed in the spiritual aspects of adaptation, the socially isolating consequences of diabetes, as well as gender differences in social support and management. Understanding the lived experiences of patients contributes to planning more effective interventions keeping the social and cultural context in mind for more effective management of diabetes. Additionally, acknowledging and supporting women's needs in diabetes management is called for.\n",

Furthermore, the association of plasma apoB/apoA1 ratio with clinical characteristics and adverse cardiac remodeling is still limited in chronic HF with mildly reduced ejection fraction (HFmrEF) elderly patients. Therefore, this study investigated the association of apoB/apoA1 ratio with clinical characteristics and adverse cardiac remodeling in chronic HFmrEF elderly patients. A total of 587 Chinese elderly (≥65 years) with coronary heart disease (CHD), HFmrEF (EF 40-50%) and related blood biochemical data were collected retrospectively. The cross-sectional data of echocardiographic and blood parameters were compared between binary apoB/apoA1 groups. In the elderly CHD patients with chronic HFmrEF, the univariate correlation analysis showed that apoB/apoA1 was correlated with younger age, increased prevalence of type 2 diabetes, erythrocytes, platelet/lymphocyte ratio (PLR), D-dimer, fibrinogen, high sensitivity C-reactive protein and uric acid, and adverse cardiac remodeling (All <i>P</i> < 0.05). However, multivariate logistic binary regression analysis found that high apoB/apoA1 ratio (≥0.62) was independently correlated with younger age, increased erythrocytes, PLR, D-dimer and uric acid, and adverse cardiac remodeling (All <i>P</i> < 0.05). In this retrospective study, the high apoB/apoA1 ratio is found to be associated with younger age, increased erythrocytes, PLR, D-dimer and uric acid, and adverse cardiac remodeling in Chinese CHD elderly with chronic HFmrEF.\n",

The single-blind, randomized, sham-controlled clinical trial was conducted between January 2019 and October 2019. Twenty-four type 2 diabetics (8 males, 16 females; mean age: 60.4±8.9 years; range, 40 to 78 years) with peripheral neuropathy were randomly allocated to control (n=12) and study (n=12) groups. The study group received the capacitive Tecar therapy with 10 to 30% intensity and infrared radiation in 10 sessions. The controls received the same protocol with zero intensity. The neuropathy symptoms and nerve conduction velocity were evaluated at baseline, after 10 sessions, and six weeks after the end of sessions. There were no significant differences in variables (p>0.05). In this way, the homogeneity of the data variables was confirmed. Moreover, the results of two-way mixed analysis of variance showed that improvement of neuropathy symptoms in the study group was significantly more than controls in all stages (p<0.001). After 10 sessions, the results of post hoc analysis showed that the neuropathy symptoms and tibial nerve conduction velocity were significantly improved in both groups (p<0.05). However, there was no change in these outcomes after six weeks in the control group (p>0.05). Tecar therapy could improve neuropathy symptoms and tibial nerve conduction velocity in diabetic individuals with peripheral neuropathy. Therefore, the use of this method to control the symptoms of diabetic patients can be recommended.\n",

Research in clinical settings has revealed that Yanggan Yishui Granule (YGYSG) has significant therapeutic effects on HN. However, the material basis and action mechanisms of YGYSG against HN remain unclear. Consequently, this study utilized a comprehensive method integrating ultraperformance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF/MS), network pharmacology, and molecular docking to delineate the active ingredients and potential therapeutic mechanisms of YGYSG for treating HN. Firstly, sixty distinct components were recognized in total as potential active ingredients in YGYSG by UPLC-Q-TOF/MS. Subsequently, the mechanisms of YGYSG against HN were revealed for the first time using network pharmacology. 23 ingredients played key roles in the complete network and were the key active ingredients, which could affect the renin-angiotensin system, fluid shear stress and atherosclerosis, HIF-1 signaling pathway, and AGE-RAGE signaling pathway in diabetic complications by regulating 29 key targets such as TNF, IL6, ALB, EGFR, ACE, and MMP2. YGYSG could treat HN through the suppression of inflammatory response and oxidative stress, attenuating the proliferation of renal vascular smooth muscle cells, lessening glomerular capillary systolic pressure, and ameliorating renal dysfunction and vascular damage through the aforementioned targets and pathways. Molecular docking results revealed that most key active ingredients exhibited a high affinity for binding to the key targets. This study pioneers in clarifying the bioactive compounds and molecular mechanisms of YGYSG against HN and offers scientific reference into the clinical application.\n",

In this study we explored how direct and indirect communication rules for verbal support seeking by patients with diabetes were perceived among Dutch and Surinamese female participants, and whether the appropriateness differed for the ingroup, outgroup and intercultural support seeker-support provider interactions. The study applied a 2 (direct versus indirect support seeking) X 2 (Surinamese patient versus Dutch patient) X 2 (Surinamese support provider versus Dutch support provider)-design. Dutch and Surinamese participants (<i>N</i> = 686) were randomly assigned to one of the eight conditions in which they were provided with a depiction of the patient, the direct or indirect request for help, and the help provider. The main outcome was the rated appropriateness of the help-seeking request in the specific context. The results revealed a significant main effect of communication style: both, Surinamese and Dutch participants evaluated the direct help-seeking as more appropriate compared to indirect help-seeking, independent of patient or provider culture. This effect was particularly strong in participants who scored high on the individual difference in independent self, as shown by a significant interaction. Literature usually identifies that Surinamese and Dutch populations have different cultural backgrounds and values that express themselves in different attitudes, in general more collectivistic and more individualistic, respectively. However, with regard to help seeking preferences the study results did not verify this expectation. These findings underscore the importance of the support providers' role in assessing and understanding the individuals' communication style with regard to help-seeking, rather than assuming communication preferences on the basis of cultural background.\n",

The current work evaluated the protective ability of ethyl alcohol extract of leaves from holy basil (<i>Ocimum sanctum</i> Linn) against inflammation, oxidative stress, glycation and advanced glycation endproducts formation. Various <i>in vitro</i> assays assessed prementioned properties of holy basil. In addition, molecular docking was conducted. The highest hydrogen peroxide reduction activity (72.7 %) and maximum percentage of DPPH scavenging (71.3 %) depicted its vigorous antioxidant abilities. Furthermore, it showed the most excellent protection against proteinase activity (67.247 %), prevention of denaturation of egg albumin (65.29 %), and BSA (bovine serum albumin) (68.87 %) with 600 µg/ml. Percent aggregation index (57.528 %), browning intensity (56.61 %), and amyloid structure (57.0 %) were all reduced significantly using 600 μg/ml of extract. Additionally, the antimicrobial potential was also confirmed. According to a molecular docking study, active leaf extract ingredients were found to bind with superoxide dismutase, catalase, and carbonic anhydrase. As a conclusion, <i>O. sanctum</i> has a variety of health-promoting properties that may reduce the severity of many diseases in diabetic patients. However, in order to ascertain the mechanisms of action of the components of its leaves in disease prevention, more thorough research based on pharmacological aspects is needed.\n",

This study aimed to compare balance performance, FE, social participation and QoL between individuals with T2DM with and without VD. The participants comprised 161 T2DM with VD and 161 without VD. Three clinical tests used for confirming VD included the Head Impulse Test (HIT), the Dix Hallpike Test (DHT) and the Supine Roll Test (SRT). The scores of static and dynamic balances, FE, social participation and QoL were compared between groups. The balance performance, FE, social participation and QoL were lower in the group with VD. The number of patients who had severe social restriction was higher in T2DM with VD than without VD (58.4% <i>vs</i> 48.4%). Moreover, all domains of QoL (physical, psychological, social relationships and environmental) were lower in T2DM with VD than without VD. The presence of VD in T2DM patients was associated with decreased physical balance performances and increased social and QoL disengagement. Comprehensive management related to balance and FE, as well as the monitoring to support social participation and QoL, should be emphasized in patients with T2DM with VD.\n",
            "ID: 38766443, Title: Insulin therapy in type 2 diabetes: Insights into clinical efficacy, patient-reported outcomes, and adherence challenges., Abstract: Insulin therapy plays a crucial role in the management of type 2 diabetes as the disease progresses. Over the past century, insulin formulations have undergone significant modifications and bioengineering, resulting in a diverse range of available insulin products. These products show distinct pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles. Consequently, various insulin regimens have em-erged for the management of type 2 diabetes, including premixed formulations and combinations of basal and bolus insulins. The utilization of different insulin regimens yields disparate clinical outcomes, adverse events, and, notably, patient-reported outcomes (PROs). PROs provide valuable insights from the patient's perspective, serving as a valuable mine of information for enhancing healthcare and informing clinical decisions. Adherence to insulin therapy, a critical patient-reported outcome, significantly affects clinical outcomes and is influenced by multiple factors. This review provides insights into the clinical effectiveness of various insulin preparations, PROs, and factors impacting insulin therapy adherence, with the aim of enhancing healthcare practices and informing clinical decisions for individuals with type 2 diabetes.\n",
            "ID: 38766442, Title: Associations of serum D-dimer and glycosylated hemoglobin levels with third-trimester fetal growth restriction in gestational diabetes mellitus., Abstract: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a special type of diabetes that commonly occurs in women during pregnancy and involves impaired glucose tolerance and abnormal glucose metabolism; GDM is diagnosed for the first time during pregnancy and can affect fetal growth and development. To investigate the associations of serum D-dimer (D-D) and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels with third-trimester fetal growth restriction (FGR) in GDM patients. The clinical data of 164 pregnant women who were diagnosed with GDM and delivered at the Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital of Fudan University from January 2021 to January 2023 were analyzed retrospectively. Among these women, 63 whose fetuses had FGR were included in the FGR group, and 101 women whose fetuses had normal body weights were included in the normal body weight group (normal group). Fasting venous blood samples were collected from the elbow at 28-30 wk gestation and 1-3 d before delivery to measure serum D-D and HbA1c levels for comparative analysis. The diagnostic value of serum D-D and HbA1c levels for FGR was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic analysis, and the influencing factors of third-trimester FGR in GDM patients were analyzed by logistic regression. Serum fasting blood glucose, fasting insulin, D-D and HbA1c levels were significantly greater in the FGR group than in the normal group, while the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance values were lower (<i>P</i> < 0.05). Regarding the diagnosis of FGR based on serum D-D and HbA1c levels, the areas under the curves (AUCs) were 0.826 and 0.848, the cutoff values were 3.04 mg/L and 5.80%, the sensitivities were 81.0% and 79.4%, and the specificities were 88.1% and 87.1%, respectively. The AUC of serum D-D plus HbA1c levels for diagnosing FGR was 0.928, and the sensitivity and specificity were 84.1% and 91.1%, respectively. High D-D and HbA1c levels were risk factors for third-trimester FGR in GDM patients (<i>P</i> < 0.05). D-D and HbA1c levels can indicate the occurrence of FGR in GDM patients in the third trimester of pregnancy to some extent, and their combination can be used as an important index for the early prediction of FGR.\n",
            "ID: 38766441, Title: Efficacy of Huangma Ding or autologous platelet-rich gel for the diabetic lower extremity arterial disease patients with foot ulcers., Abstract: Diabetes foot is one of the most serious complications of diabetes and an important cause of death and disability, traditional treatment has poor efficacy and there is an urgent need to develop a practical treatment method. To investigate whether Huangma Ding or autologous platelet-rich gel (APG) treatment would benefit diabetic lower extremity arterial disease (LEAD) patients with foot ulcers. A total of 155 diabetic LEAD patients with foot ulcers were enrolled and divided into three groups: Group A (62 patients; basal treatment), Group B (38 patients; basal treatment and APG), and Group C (55 patients; basal treatment and Huangma Ding). All patients underwent routine follow-up visits for six months. After follow-up, we calculated the changes in all variables from baseline and determined the differences between groups and the relationships between parameters. The infection status of the three groups before treatment was the same. Procalcitonin (PCT) improved after APG and Huangma Ding treatment more than after traditional treatment and was significantly greater in Group C than in Group B. Logistic regression analysis revealed that PCT was positively correlated with total amputation, primary amputation, and minor amputation rates. The ankle-brachial pressure and the transcutaneous oxygen pressure in Groups B and C were greater than those in Group A. The major amputation rate, minor amputation rate, and total amputation times in Groups B and C were lower than those in Group A. Our research indicated that diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) lead to major amputation, minor amputation, and total amputation through local infection and poor microcirculation and macrocirculation. Huangma Ding and APG were effective attreating DFUs. The clinical efficacy of Huangma Ding was better than that of autologous platelet gel, which may be related to the better control of local infection by Huangma Ding. This finding suggested that in patients with DFUs combined with coinfection, controlling infection is as important as improving circulation.\n",
            "ID: 38766440, Title: Impact of tibial transverse transport in tissue regeneration and wound healing with perspective on diabetic foot ulcers., Abstract: In this editorial, we comment on an article by Liao <i>et al</i> published in the current issue of the <i>World Journal of Diabetes</i>. We focus on the clinical significance of tibial transverse transport (TTT) as an effective treatment for patients with diabetic foot ulcers (DFU). TTT has been associated with tissue regeneration, improved blood circulation, reduced amputation rates, and increased expression of early angiogenic factors. Mechanistically, TTT can influence macrophage polarization and growth factor upregulation. Despite this potential, the limitations and conflicting results of existing studies justify the need for further research into its optimal application and development. These clinical implications highlight the efficacy of TTT in recalcitrant DFU and provide lasting stimuli for tissue re-generation, and blood vessel and bone marrow improvement. Immunomodulation <i>via</i> systemic responses contributes to its therapeutic potential. Future studies should investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms to enhance our understanding and the efficacy of TTT. This manuscript emphasizes the potential of TTT in limb preservation and diabetic wound healing and suggests avenues for preventive measures against limb amputation in diabetes and peripheral artery disease. Here, we highlight the clinical significance of the TTT and its importance in healing DFU to promote the use of this technique in tissue regeneration.\n",
            "ID: 38766439, Title: Synaptotagmins family affect glucose transport in retinal pigment epithelial cells through their ubiquitination-mediated degradation and glucose transporter-1 regulation., Abstract: Synaptotagmins (SYTs) are a family of 17 membrane transporters that function as calcium ion sensors during the release of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent neurotransmitters and hormones. However, few studies have reported whether members of the SYT family play a role in glucose uptake in diabetic retinopathy (DR) through Ca<sup>2+</sup>/glucose transporter-1 (GLUT1) and the possible regulatory mechanism of SYTs. To elucidate the role of the SYT family in the regulation of glucose transport in retinal pigment epithelial cells and explore its potential as a therapeutic target for the clinical management of DR. DR was induced by streptozotocin in C57BL/6J mice and by high glucose medium in human retinal pigment epithelial cells (ARPE-19). Bioinformatics analysis, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, Western blot, flow cytometry, ELISA, HE staining, and TUNEL staining were used for analysis. Six differentially expressed proteins (SYT2, SYT3, SYT4, SYT7, SYT11, and SYT13) were found between the DR and control groups, and SYT4 was highly expressed. Hyperglycemia induces SYT4 overexpression, manipulates Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx to induce GLUT1 fusion with the plasma membrane, promotes abnormal expression of the glucose transporter GLUT1 and excessive glucose uptake, induces ARPE-19 cell apoptosis, and promotes DR progression. Parkin deficiency inhibits the proteasomal degradation of SYT4 in DR, resulting in SYT4 accumulation and enhanced GLUT1 fusion with the plasma membrane, and these effects were blocked by oe-Parkin treatment. Moreover, dysregulation of the myelin transcription factor 1 (Myt1)-induced transcription of SYT4 in DR further activated the SYT4-mediated stimulus-secretion coupling process, and this process was inhibited in the oe-MYT1-treated group. Our study reveals the key role of SYT4 in regulating glucose transport in retinal pigment epithelial cells during the pathogenesis of DR and the underlying mechanism and suggests potential therapeutic targets for clinical DR.\n",

            "ID: 38766437, Title: Polycytosine RNA-binding protein 1 regulates osteoblast function <i>via</i> a ferroptosis pathway in type 2 diabetic osteoporosis., Abstract: Recently, type 2 diabetic osteoporosis (T2DOP) has become a research hotspot for the complications of diabetes, but the specific mechanism of its occurrence and development remains unknown. Ferroptosis caused by iron overload is con-sidered an important cause of T2DOP. Polycytosine RNA-binding protein 1 (PCBP1), an iron ion chaperone, is considered a protector of ferroptosis. To investigate the existence of ferroptosis and specific role of PCBP1 in the development of type 2 diabetes. A cell counting kit-8 assay was used to detect changes in osteoblast viability under high glucose (HG) and/or ferroptosis inhibitors at different concentrations and times. Transmission electron microscopy was used to examine the morphological changes in the mitochondria of osteoblasts under HG, and western blotting was used to detect the expression levels of PCBP1, ferritin, and the ferroptosis-related protein glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4). A lentivirus silenced and overexpressed PCBP1. Western blotting was used to detect the expression levels of the osteoblast functional proteins osteoprotegerin (OPG) and osteocalcin (OCN), whereas flow cytometry was used to detect changes in reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in each group. Under HG, the viability of osteoblasts was considerably decreased, the number of mitochondria undergoing atrophy was considerably increased, PCBP1 and ferritin expression levels were increased, and GPX4 expression was decreased. Western blotting results demonstrated that infection with lentivirus overexpressing PCBP1, increased the expression levels of ferritin, GPX4, OPG, and OCN, compared with the HG group. Flow cytometry results showed a reduction in ROS, and an opposite result was obtained after silencing PCBP1. PCBP1 may protect osteoblasts and reduce the harm caused by ferroptosis by promoting ferritin expression under a HG environment. Moreover, PCBP1 may be a potential therapeutic target for T2DOP.\n",

Investigating these metabolites could offer valuable insights into the pathophy-siology of NAFLD in T2DM. To identify potential metabolite biomarkers capable of distinguishing between NAFLD and T2DM. A training model was developed involving 399 participants, comprising 113 healthy controls (HCs), 134 individuals with T2DM without NAFLD, and 152 individuals with T2DM and NAFLD. External validation encompassed 172 participants. NAFLD patients were divided based on liver fibrosis scores. The analytical approach employed univariate testing, orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis, logistic regression, receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, and decision curve analysis to pinpoint and assess the diagnostic value of serum biomarkers. Compared to HCs, both T2DM and NAFLD groups exhibited diminished levels of specific BAs. In UFAs, particular acids exhibited a positive correlation with NAFLD risk in T2DM, while the ω-6:ω-3 UFA ratio demonstrated a negative correlation. Levels of α-linolenic acid and γ-linolenic acid were linked to significant liver fibrosis in NAFLD. The validation cohort substantiated the predictive efficacy of these biomarkers for assessing NAFLD risk in T2DM patients. This study underscores the connection between altered BA and UFA profiles and the presence of NAFLD in individuals with T2DM, proposing their potential as biomarkers in the pathogenesis of NAFLD.\n",
            "ID: 38766435, Title: Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay of 3 Screen Islet Cell Autoantibody in patients with autoimmune thyroid disease., Abstract: In recent years, the emergence of multiplex technology that can simultaneously measure multiple anti-islet autoantibodies has become particularly valuable for the staging and early diagnosis of immune-mediated type 1 diabetes (T1D). While it has been established that 20%-30% of T1D patients suffer from autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD), there is limited available data regarding the presence of anti-islet autoantibodies in AITD patients. Among commercially available anti-islet autoantibodies, glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 autoantibodies (GADAs) are often the first marker measured in general clinical practice. To investigate the frequency of anti-islet autoantibodies in AITD patients. Our study involved four hundred ninety-five AITD patients, categorized into three distinct groups: AITD with T1D (<i>n</i> = 18), AITD with phenotypic type 2 diabetes (T2D) (<i>n</i> = 81), and AITD without diabetes (<i>n</i> = 396), and the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was employed to determine the frequencies of 3 Screen Islet Cell Autoantibody (3 Screen ICA), GADA, insulinoma-associated antigen-2 autoantibodies (IA-2As), and zinc transporter 8 autoantibodies (ZnT8As) within these groups. The frequency of 3 Screen ICA in AITD patients with T1D, T2D, and those without diabetes were 88.9%, 6.2%, and 5.1%, respectively, with no significant difference seen between the latter two groups. Notably, the frequency of 3 Screen ICA was 11.1% higher in AITD patients with T1D, 1.3% higher in AITD patients with T2D, and 1.1% higher in AITD patients without diabetes compared to GADA, respectively. Furthermore, 12.5%, 20.0%, and 20.0% of the 3 Screen ICA-positive patients were negative for GADA. Additionally, 1.3% of the AITD patients who tested negative for 3 Screen ICA in both the AITD with T2D and non-diabetic AITD groups were found to be positive for individual autoantibodies. Among the 3 Screen ICA-positive patients, there was a significantly higher proportion of individuals with multiple autoantibodies in AITD patients with T1D compared to those without diabetes (37.5% <i>vs</i> 5.0%, <i>P</i> < 0.05). However, this proportion was similar to that in AITD patients with T2D (20.0%). Nevertheless, there was no significant difference in 3 Screen ICA titers between AITD patients with T1D and those without diabetes (436.8 ± 66.4 <i>vs</i> 308.1 ± 66.4 index). Additionally, no significant difference in 3 Screen ICA titers was observed between Graves' disease and Hashimoto's thyroiditis in any of the groups. Our findings reveal that some AITD patients without diabetes exhibit 3 Screen ICA titers comparable to those in AITD patients with T1D. Thus, 3 Screen ICA outperforms GADA in identifying latent anti-islet autoantibody-positive individuals among AITD patients.\n",
            "ID: 38766434, Title: Estrogen restores disordered lipid metabolism in visceral fat of prediabetic mice., Abstract: Visceral obesity is increasingly prevalent among adolescents and young adults and is commonly recognized as a risk factor for type 2 diabetes. Estrogen [17β-estradiol (E2)] is known to offer protection against obesity <i>via</i> diverse me-chanisms, while its specific effects on visceral adipose tissue (VAT) remain to be fully elucidated. To investigate the impact of E2 on the gene expression profile within VAT of a mouse model of prediabetes. Metabolic parameters were collected, encompassing body weight, weights of visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissues (VAT and SAT), random blood glucose levels, glucose tolerance, insulin tolerance, and overall body composition. The gene expression profiles of VAT were quantified utilizing the Whole Mouse Genome Oligo Microarray and subsequently analyzed through Agilent Feature Extraction software. Functional and pathway analyses were conducted employing Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analyses, respectively. Feeding a high-fat diet (HFD) moderately increased the weights of both VAT and SAT, but this increase was mitigated by the protective effect of endogenous E2. Conversely, ovariectomy (OVX) led to a significant increase in VAT weight and the VAT/SAT weight ratio, and this increase was also reversed with E2 treatment. Notably, OVX diminished the expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism compared to HFD feeding alone, signaling a widespread reduction in lipid metabolic activity, which was completely counteracted by E2 administration. This study provides a comprehensive insight into E2's local and direct protective effects against visceral adiposity in VAT at the gene level. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that the HFD-induced over-nutritional challenge disrupted the gene expression profile of visceral fat, leading to a universally decreased lipid metabolic status in E2 deficient mice. E2 treatment effectively reversed this condition, shedding light on the mechanistic role and therapeutic potential of E2 in combating visceral obesity.\n",
            "ID: 38766433, Title: Glucokinase regulatory protein rs780094 polymorphism is associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and nephropathy., Abstract: In this editorial, we comment on the article by Liu <i>et al</i> published in the recent issue of the <i>World Journal of Diabetes</i> (Relationship between GCKR gene rs780094 polymorphism and type 2 diabetes with albuminuria). Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic disorder characterized by dysregulated glucose homeostasis. The persistent elevated blood glucose level in T2DM significantly increases the risk of developing severe complications, including cardiovascular disease, re-tinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy. T2DM arises from a complex interplay between genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors. Global genomic studies have identified numerous genetic variations associated with an increased risk of T2DM. Specifically, variations within the glucokinase regulatory protein (GCKR) gene have been linked to heightened susceptibility to T2DM and its associated complications. The clinical trial by Liu <i>et al</i> further elucidates the role of the GCKR rs780094 polymorphism in T2DM and nephropathy development. Their findings demonstrate that individuals carrying the CT or TT genotype at the GCKR rs780094 locus are at a higher risk of developing T2DM with albuminuria compared to those with the CC genotype. These findings highlight the importance of genetic testing and risk assessment in T2DM to develop effective preventive strategies and personalized treatment plans.\n",

To evaluate the risk of infection in patients with T2DM treated with dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors. Electronic databases were searched. The selection criteria included randomized controlled trials focused on cardiovascular outcomes. In these studies, the effects of DPP-4 inhibitors were directly compared to those of either other active anti-diabetic treatments or placebo. Six trials involving 53616 patients were deemed eligible. We calculated aggregate relative risks employing both random-effects and fixed-effects approaches, contingent upon the context. The application of DPP-4 inhibitors showed no significant link to the overall infection risk [0.98 (0.95, 1.02)] or the risk of serious infections [0.96 (0.85, 1.08)], additionally, no significant associations were found with opportunistic infections [0.69 (0.46, 1.04)], site-specific infections [respiratory infection 0.99 (0.96, 1.03), urinary tract infections 1.02 (0.95, 1.10), abdominal and gastrointestinal infections 1.02 (0.83, 1.25), skin structure and soft tissue infections 0.81 (0.60, 1.09), bone infections 0.96 (0.68, 1.36), and bloodstream infections 0.97 (0.80, 1.18)]. This meta-analysis of data from cardiovascular outcome trials revealed no heightened infection risk in patients undergoing DPP-4 inhibitor therapy compared to control cohorts.\n",

Its etiology is closely tied to imbalanced dietary practices and sedentary lifestyles. Conversely, increasing die-tary fiber (DF) intake has consistently demonstrated health benefits in numerous studies, including improvements in glycemic control and weight management. To investigate the efficacy of DF interventions in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). A systematic literature review was conducted to explore the association between DF intake and the management of T2DM. Following the inclusion and exclusion criteria, a total of 26 studies were included in this review. The main strategies implied to increased DF intake were: High DF diet plus acarbose (2 studies); DF supplements (14 studies); and high DF diets (10 studies). Overall, most studies indicated that increased DF intake resulted in im-provements in glycemic control and weight management in T2DM patients. DF represents a valuable strategy in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, improving health outcomes. DF intake offers the potential to improve quality of life and reduce complications and mortality associated with diabetes. Likewise, through supplements or enriched foods, DF contributes significantly to the control of several markers such as HbA1c, blood glucose, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein, and body weight.\n",

However, the mechanism through which <i>Radix Salviae</i> treats DPN remains unclear. Therefore, we aimed to explore the mechanism of action of <i>Radix Salviae</i> against DPN using network pharmacology. The active ingredients and target genes of <i>Radix Salviae</i> were screened using the TCM pharmacology database and analysis platform. The genes associated with DPN were obtained from the Gene Cards and OMIM databases, a drug-com-position-target-disease network was constructed, and a protein-protein inter-action network was subsequently constructed to screen the main targets. Gene Ontology (GO) functional annotation and pathway enrichment analysis were performed <i>via</i> the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) using Bioconductor. A total of 56 effective components, 108 targets and 4581 DPN-related target genes of <i>Radix Salviae</i> were screened. Intervention with <i>Radix Salviae</i> for DPN mainly involved 81 target genes. The top 30 major targets were selected for enrichment analysis of GO and KEGG pathways. These results suggested that <i>Radix Salviae</i> could treat DPN by regulating the AGE-RAGE signaling pathway and the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. Therefore, Danshen may affect DPN by regulating inflammation and apoptosis.\n",

            "ID: 38766427, Title: Tuberculosis-diabetes comorbidities: Mechanistic insights for clinical considerations and treatment challenges., Abstract: Tuberculosis (TB) remains a leading cause of death among infectious diseases, particularly in poor countries. Viral infections, multidrug-resistant and ex-tensively drug-resistant TB strains, as well as the coexistence of chronic illnesses such as diabetes mellitus (DM) greatly aggravate TB morbidity and mortality. DM [particularly type 2 DM (T2DM)] and TB have converged making their control even more challenging. Two contemporary global epidemics, TB-DM behaves like a syndemic, a synergistic confluence of two highly prevalent diseases. T2DM is a risk factor for developing more severe forms of multi-drug resistant-TB and TB recurrence after preventive treatment. Since a bidirectional relationship exists between TB and DM, it is necessary to concurrently treat both, and promote recommendations for the joint management of both diseases. There are also some drug-drug interactions resulting in adverse treatment outcomes in TB-DM patients including treatment failure, and reinfection. In addition, autophagy may play a role in these comorbidities. Therefore, the TB-DM comorbidities present several health challenges, requiring a focus on multidisciplinary collaboration and integrated strategies, to effectively deal with this double burden. To effectively manage the comorbidity, further screening in affected countries, more suitable drugs, and better treatment strategies are required.\n",

            "ID: 38766425, Title: Cardioprotective effects of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists in heart failure: Myth or truth?, Abstract: Therapy with glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP1) receptor agonists has raised great interest for its beneficial cardiovascular effects in preventing atherosclerosis and heart failure-related outcomes. However, while evidence about atherosclerosis consistently suggests a cardioprotective potential with class effect, controversies remain on its impact on heart failure. GLP1 receptor agonists appear to prevent hospitalization for new-onset heart failure and reduce symptoms in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (as demonstrated by the recent STEP-HFpEF Trial). Still, GLP1 agonism has resulted in neutral or even harmful effects in patients with established heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (the LIVE trial). GLP1 receptor agonists benefit the cardiovascular system indirectly through their marked metabolic effects (improved weight management, glycemic control, blood pressure, systemic and tissue inflammation), while direct effects on the heart have been questioned. Nonetheless, weight loss alone achieved through GLP1 receptor agonists has failed in improving left ventricular functions. Tirzepatide is a dual agonist of GLP1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide, representing an innovative treatment option in diabetes with a major impact on weight loss and promising cardiovascular benefits. Whether this class of therapies is going to change the history of heart failure is an ongoing debate.\n",

            "ID: 38766423, Title: Challenges and pitfalls of youth-onset type 2 diabetes., Abstract: The incidence and prevalence of youth-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are increasing. The rise in frequency and severity of childhood obesity, inclination to sedentary lifestyle, and epigenetic risks related to prenatal hyperglycemia exposure are important drivers of the youth-onset T2DM epidemic and might as well be responsible for the early onset of diabetes complications. Indeed, youth-onset T2DM has a more extreme metabolic phenotype than adult-onset T2DM, with greater insulin resistance and more rapid deterioration of beta cell function. Therefore, intermediate complications such as microalbuminuria develop in late childhood or early adulthood, while end-stage complications develop in mid-life. Due to the lack of efficacy and safety data, several drugs available for the treatment of adults with T2DM have not been approved in youth, reducing the pharmacological treatment options. In this mini review, we will try to address the present challenges and pitfalls related to youth-onset T2DM and summarize the available interventions to mitigate the risk of microvascular and macrovascular complications.\n",
            "ID: 38766422, Title: Drawing lines in the sand: The growing threat of obesity in type 1 diabetes., Abstract: In this editorial, we comment on the article by Zeng <i>et al</i> published in the recent issue of the <i>World Journal of Diabetes</i> in 2024. We focus on the epidemiological, pathophysiological, and clinical interplay between obesity and type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Overweight and obesity represent a growing threat for modern societies and people with T1DM could not be an exception to this rule. Chronic exogenous insulin administration, genetic and epigenetic factors, and psy-chosocial and behavioral parameters, along with the modern way of life that incorporates unhealthy eating patterns and physical inactivity, set the stage for the increasing obesity rates in T1DM. As our knowledge of the underlying mechanisms that lead to the development of obesity and hyperglycemia expands, it becomes clear that there are overlap zones in the pathophysiology of the two main types of diabetes. Stereotypes regarding strict dividing lines between \"autoimmune\" and \"metabolic\" phenotypes increase the risk of trapping physicians into ineffective therapeutic approaches, instead of individualized diabetes care. In this context, the use of adjuncts to insulin therapy that have the potential to alleviate cardiorenal risk and decrease body weight can reduce the burden of obesity in patients with T1DM.\n",
            "ID: 38766421, Title: Disparate outcomes in Hispanic patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease/steatohepatitis and type 2 diabetes: Large cohort study., Abstract: Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) are a growing health burden across a significant portion of the global patient population. However, these conditions seem to have disparate rates and outcomes between different ethnic populations. The combination of MASLD/MASH and type 2 diabetes increases the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and Hispanic patients experience the greatest burden, particularly those in South Texas. To compare outcomes between Hispanic and non-Hispanic patients in the United States, while further focusing on the Hispanic population within Southeast Texas to determine whether the documented disparity in outcomes is a function of geographical circumstance or if there is a more widespread reason that all clinicians must account for in prognostic consideration. This cohort analysis was conducted with data obtained from TriNetX, LLC (\"TriNetX\"), a global federated health research network that provides access to deidentified medical records from healthcare organizations worldwide. Two cohort networks were used: University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) hospital and the United States national database collective to determine whether disparities were related to geographic regions, like Southeast Texas. This study findings revealed Hispanics/Latinos have a statistically significant higher occurrence of HCC, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and liver fibrosis/cirrhosis in both the United States and the UTMB Hispanic/Latino groups. All-cause mortality in Hispanics/Latinos was lower within the United States group and not statistically elevated in the UTMB cohort. This would appear to support that Hispanic patients in Southeast Texas are not uniquely affected compared to the national Hispanic population.\n",
            "ID: 38766358, Title: Physical activity and sedentary behaviour of Bahraini people with type 2 diabetes: A cross-sectional study., Abstract: Study patterns of physical activity and sedentary behaviour and the influence of demographics and body mass index (BMI) on these behaviours amongst Bahraini adults with type 2 diabetes over 10 weeks using an activity tracker. This cross-sectional observational study was conducted at a Bahrain government health centre. Thirty-three Bahraini Arab adults, 30-60 years old, with controlled type 2 diabetes, wore a Fitbit Flex 2<sup>TM</sup> activity tracker for 10 weeks. Data on age, sex, marital and employment status, education and BMI were collected at the start of the study. A total of <i>N</i> = 32 participants completed the study. The average steps per day were 7859 ± 4131, and there were no differences between baseline, week 5 and 10. A third of participants were sedentary, based on a threshold of 5000 steps/day. Females accumulated fewer average daily steps than males (6728 ± 2936 vs. 10,281 ± 4623, <i>p</i> = 0.018). Daily averages for physical activity intensity were as follows: sedentary (786 ± 109 min), light (250 ± 76 min), moderate (9 ± 10 min) and vigorous (12 ± 18 min). Males had higher daily averages versus females for moderate (13 ± 9 vs. 5 ± 9 min, <i>p</i> = 0.018) and vigorous physical activity (21 ± 23 vs. 5 ± 7 min, <i>p</i> = 0.034). 91% of participants wore the device ≥10 h/day. The adherence rate was 79% based on percentage of days the device was worn continuously over 10 weeks. Future physical activity interventions should target sedentary and female participants with type 2 diabetes. In addition, we need to understand the facilitators and barriers to physical activity and the physical activity preferences of these two subgroups.\n"
