38769011,Evaluation of systemic medications associated with diabetic retinopathy: a nested case-control study from the UK Biobank.,"This study aims to investigate the associations between commonly used systemic medications and diabetic retinopathy (DR). Individuals with linked primary care prescription data from the UK Biobank were included. Cases were defined as individuals with a Hospital Episode Statistics-coded or primary care recorded diagnosis of DR or self-reported DR. Controls were matched for age, sex, glycosylated haemoglobin, duration of diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension status and cardiovascular disease status. ORs and 95% CIs were calculated using conditional univariate and multivariable logistic regression models. A total of 3377 case subjects with DR were included in the study and matched with 3377 control subjects. In multivariable logistic regression, increased odds of incident DR were observed for exposure to short-acting insulins (OR 1.63; 95% CI 1.22 to 2.18), medium-acting insulins (OR 2.10; 95% CI 1.60 to 2.75), sulfonylureas (OR 1.30; 95% CI 1.16 to 1.46). Instead, the use of fibrates (OR 0.71; 95% CI 0.53 to 0.94) and Cox-2 inhibitors (OR 0.68; 95% CI 0.58 to 0.79) was associated with decreased odds of incident DR. Dose-response relationships were observed for all five drug categories (all p<0.05). This study comprehensively investigated the associations between systemic medication use and DR and found significant associations between the use of short-acting insulins, medium-acting insulins and sulfonylureas with increased odds of incident DR. In contrast, fibrates and Cox-2 inhibitors were associated with decreased odds of incident DR. These findings may provide valuable insights into DM medication management and serve as a reference for the prevention of DR in patients with DM.",0,prevention
38768904,Postpartum Blood Pressure Control and the Rate of Readmission.,"Postpartum hypertension is a major contributor to the rising maternal mortality rates in the United States with nearly half of maternal deaths occurring after delivery. Previous studies have found evidence that the maximum blood pressure reading during the labor and delivery admission can predict readmission, however the optimal blood pressure to reduce the need for readmissions and additional medical treatment in the postpartum period is not known. To investigate the relationship between postpartum blood pressure control at discharge and readmission within the first six weeks after delivery. Data were obtained from Cosmos, an EHR-based, HIPAA-defined limited data set that includes more than 1.4 million birth encounters. All birthing parents with blood pressure data after delivery were included. Demographic information, medications, and readmissions were queried from the dataset. Patients were grouped into categories based on blood pressure readings in the 24 hours prior to discharge (≥160/110, ≥150/100, ≥140/90, ≥130/80, ≥120/80, and <120/80). The readmission rates across these groups were compared. Planned sub-analyses included stratification by the use of antihypertensive medications and a sensitivity analysis using the highest blood pressure during admission. Covariates included maternal age, pre-existing diabetes or lupus, and BMI. The analysis included 1,265,766 total birth encounters, 30.9% in the referent group, 120/80, 31.0% in <120/80, 19.7% in ≥130/80, 1.3% in ≥140/90, 4.0% in ≥150/100, and 1.6% in ≥160/110 groups. In the first six weeks after delivery, readmission rates rose with higher blood pressure readings. More than 5% of postpartum patients with the highest blood pressure readings (≥160/110) were readmitted. They were almost three times more likely to be readmitted than patients whose highest blood pressure reading fell into the referent group (120/80) (OR 2.90 [95%CI 2.69-3.12]). Patients with blood pressures >150/100 (2.72 [2.58-2.87]), >140/90 (2.03 [1.95-2.11]), and >130/80 (1.43 [1.37-1.49]) all had higher odds of readmission while those all <120/80 had a lower risk (0.78 [0.75-0.81]). Patients who had higher blood pressures during the admission but had improved control in the 24 hours prior to discharge had lower rates of readmission than those whose blood pressures remained elevated. At all blood pressure categories, patients who received an antihypertensive prescription had higher rates of readmission. In this large, national dataset, blood pressure control at discharge and readmission in the postpartum period were significantly correlated. These data should inform postpartum hypertension treatment goals and the role of remote monitoring programs to improve maternal safety.",2,treatment
38768871,Pomegranate (Punica granatum L.) phytochemicals target the components of metabolic syndrome.,"Pomegranate (Punica granatum L.) is a multipurpose dietary and medicinal plant known for its ability to promote various health benefits. Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a complex metabolic disorder driving health and socioeconomic challenges worldwide. It may be characterized by insulin resistance, abdominal obesity, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. This study aims to conduct a review of pomegranate's effects on MetS parameters using a mechanistic approach relying on pre-clinical studies. The peel, juice, roots, bark, seeds, flowers, and leaves of the fruit present several bioactive compounds that are related mainly to anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities as well as cardioprotective, antidiabetic, and antiobesity effects. The use of the juice extract can work as a potent inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme activities, consequently regulating blood pressure. The major bioactive compounds found within the fruit are phenolic compounds (hydrolysable tannins and flavonoids) and fatty acids. Alkaloids, punicalagin, ellagitannins, ellagic acid, anthocyanins, tannins, flavonoids, luteolin, and punicic acid are also present. The antihyperglycemia, antihyperlipidemia, and weight loss promoting effects are likely related to the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. When considering clinical application, pomegranate extracts are found to be frequently well-tolerated, further supporting its efficacy as a treatment modality. We suggest that pomegranate fruit, extract, or processed products can be used to counteract MetS-related risk factors. This review represents an important step towards exploring potential avenues for further research in this area.",2,diagnosis
38768867,"Association of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor use with risk of osteoporotic fracture among older women: A nationwide, population-based cohort study.","We investigated the relationship between sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) and fracture in elderly women diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and newly prescribed antidiabetic medications (ADMs). We used the population-based cohort study data from the National Health Insurance Service of Korea (2013-2020). Women ≥65 years old with T2DM, who were newly prescribed ADMs other than glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and thiazolidinedione, and who had comprehensive health check-up data were included. A total of 1,333 SGLT2i users were matched in a 1:2 ratio with 2,626 non-SGLT2i users. After propensity score matching, mean age, body mass index, number of ADMs, and other covariates were well-balanced between SGLT2i users and non-SGLT2i users. During the follow-up period, a higher incidence of vertebral fractures in SGLT2i users than in non-SGLT2i users (incidence rate 19.2 vs. 13.8 per 1,000 person-years; hazard ratio 1.40, 95 % confidence interval 1.00-1.96, p = 0.049). No significant difference was noted in other types of fracture. SGLT2i use showed an increased risk of vertebral fracture than non-SGLT2i use in elderly women. Although further validation is required, SGLT2i should be cautiously prescribed in older women due to the potential association with fracture risk.",2,diagnosis
38768866,The effects of policosanol supplementation on blood glucose: A systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"Previous studies have assessed how supplementing with policosanol affects blood sugar levels. The outcomes, nevertheless, were not constant. Multiple electronic databases were searched including ISI Web of Science, Cochrane Library, PubMed, Google Scholar, and Scopus until February 9, 2023. To assess the effects of policosanol on glucose, we employed a random-effects or fixed-effects meta-analysis approach to examine the weighted mean differences (WMDs) and associated 95 % confidence intervals (CI) before and after policosanol and placebo administration. The final analysis comprised a total of 25 trials with 2680 participants. Compared to the control group, policosanol supplementation significantly reduced blood glucose levels (WMD: -2.24 mg/dl; 95 % CI: -4.05, -0.42, P = 0.01). Findings from subgroup analysis revealed a significant reduction of policosanol supplementation on glucose levels in period of less than 24 weeks, and in individuals below 50 years of age. Additionally, the reduction was statistically significant in dosage of 10 mg/day. Our dose-response analysis indicates no evidence of a non-linear relationship between policosanol dose and duration and changes in glucose levels (P-nonlinearity = 0.52, and P-nonlinearity = 0.52, respectively). Policosanol supplementation might improve blood glucose. Further trials with more complex designs are required to confirm the findings.",2,diagnosis

We present the case of a 73-year-old male patient with a history of type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure, who consulted for gait disorders, tremors in the extremities, and difficulty controlling conjugate gaze. During physical examination, findings consistent with PSP were noted, including hypomimia, muscle rigidity, and abnormal movements. The initial misdiagnosis of Parkinson's disease and subsequent administration of levodopa highlight the importance of accurate diagnosis in complex neurological conditions. This clinical case highlights the need for a thorough evaluation of neuro-ophthalmological symptoms and signs to ensure an appropriate therapeutic approach and improve the quality of life of patients.",1,diagnosis
38768826,Associations of meeting 24-hour movement behavior guidelines with social and emotional function in youth with ASD/ADHD.,"The 24-hour movement behavior (24-HMB) guidelines recommend that children and adolescents should limit screen time (ST), get an adequate amount of sleep (SL), and engage in sufficient physical activity (PA) to ensure health and healthy development. Meeting 24-HMB guidelines is associated with positive mental health outcomes (e.g., social and emotional function) in the general population. However, it is unclear whether such findings extend to children and adolescents with comorbid Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Thus, we examined associations of meeting 24-HMB guidelines with social and emotional function in children and adolescents with comorbid ASD/ADHD. Data from the 2020-2021 National Survey of Children's Health - a U.S. national, population-based, cross-sectional study - were used. We extracted and analyzed data on children and adolescents (aged between 6 and 17 years) diagnosed with comorbidity of ASD/ADHD. Data on movement behaviors (PA, ST, and SL) and specific outcome variables (social function and emotional function) were collected through caregiver-proxy reports. Logistic regressions were performed to examine the associations between meeting 24-HMB guidelines and social and emotional outcomes adjusting for covariates (e.g., age, sex, ethnicity, weight status, birth status, socio-economic status, and receiving medication/behavioral treatment). Among 979 children and adolescents with comorbid ASD/ADHD, only 3.8 % met all three 24-HMB guidelines. In total, 45.0 % of participants met at least one guideline, and 25.5 % of those met at least two guidelines. Compared to those who did not meet any 24-HMB guidelines, meeting SL + ST guidelines was significantly associated with lower odds of poorer social function (being bullied: OR = 0.3, 95%CI [0.1-0.7]; arguing: OR = 0.2, 95%CI[0.1-0.4]). Furthermore, meeting PA + ST + SL guidelines was associated with lower odds of poorer emotional function (depression: OR = 0.5, 95%CI[0.3-0.7]). Meeting 24-HMB guidelines was associated with better social and emotional function in U.S. children and adolescents with comorbid ASD/ADHD; however, currently very few with comorbid ASD/ADHD meet all 24-HMB guidelines. These results emphasize the importance of promoting adherence to the 24-HMB guidelines among children and adolescents facing the challenges of comorbid ASD/ADHD. These cross-sectional findings point to the need for further empirical evidence from longitudinal studies to support our conclusions.",2,treatment
38768824,Exploring the L-shaped relationship between Atherogenic Index of Plasma and depression: Results from NHANES 2005-2018.,"The Atherogenic Index of Plasma (AIP) is a novel metric linked to several diseases. However, there is inadequate evidence to investigate the relationship between AIP and depression. Therefore, we aim to elucidate the non-linear association between AIP and depression. 12,453 participants from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2005-2018 were included. The AIP was calculated as log10 (triglycerides/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol). The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) was used to identify depression (PHQ-9 ≥ 10). Weighted multivariate logistic regression, restricted cubic splines (RCS) models, subgroup analysis, and interaction tests were employed to reveal the relationship between AIP and depression. AIP was found to be significantly correlated with depression. In the fully adjusted model, elevated AIP levels were associated with higher odds of depression (odds ratio [OR] = 1.50; 95 % CI: 1.06-2.12). The RCS analysis indicated an L-shaped pattern in the relationship between depression and AIP, with inflection points at -0.289. Beyond this inflection point, individuals with elevated AIP levels were associated with higher odds of depression (OR = 2.25; 95 % CI: 1.49-3.39). Notably, the association was particularly pronounced among individuals with diabetes. This cross-sectional study is unable to establish causal relationships. There was an L-shaped association between AIP and depression among US adults. AIP has the potential value as a biological marker for depression, and maintaining AIP values below a certain threshold may help in managing depression.",2,diagnosis
38768822,"The associations between dietary flavonoids intake and risk of depressive symptom in diabetic patients: Data from NHANES 2007-2008, 2009-2010, and 2017-2018.","The increasing incidence of depressive symptoms in diabetic patients contributes to the global burden of disease, but few epidemiological studies have evaluated the relationship between dietary flavonoids intake and depressive symptoms in diabetic patients in American adults. This study intended to evaluate the associations of dietary flavonoids intake and depressive symptoms in diabetic patients in American adults. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of 1993 adults aged ≥20 years old who participated in the 2007-2008, 2009-2010, and 2017-2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES). Chi-square test and independent-sample t-test were used to compare subjects' characteristics. Logistic regression model was further used to analyze the relationship between dietary flavonoid intake and depressive symptoms in diabetic patients. Restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis was used to investigate the non-linear relationship between dietary flavonoid intake and the prevalence of depressive symptoms in diabetic patients. The weighted quartile sum (WQS) regression was used to analyze the effect of 29 flavonoids monomers. The results showed that the total flavonoid intake in the third quartile (OR, 0.635; 95 % CI,0.419-0.962; P, 0.032) was significantly associated with a reduced risk of depressive symptoms in diabetic patients compared with the lowest quartile. And there was a U-shaped association between dietary flavonoid intake and risk of depressive symptoms in diabetic patients. Top contributors of flavonoid monomers were eriodictyol, naringenin, and theaflavin-3'-gallate, accounting for a percentage of 30.83 %, 22.17 %, and 6.92 %, respectively. Moderate (56.07-207.12 mg/day) dietary flavonoid intake was associated with a reduced risk of depressive symptoms in diabetic patients. The important flavonoid monomers were eriodictyol, naringenin, and theaflavin-3'-gallate.",2,treatment
38768802,A site-specific phosphorylation in FSTL1 determines its promigratory role in wound healing.,"Follistatin like-1 (FSTL-1) is a secreted glycoprotein of mesenchymal in origin. In human skin, FSTL1 is upregulated in the epidermal keratinocytes upon acute injury and is required for the migration of keratinocytes. Failure to upregulate FSTL1 leads to the lack of keratinocyte migration and the non- healing nature of diabetic foot ulcer (DFU). FSTL1 undergoes extensive post-translational modification (PTM) at specific residues. Glycosylation at N144, N175 and N180, are the only experimentally demonstrated PTM in FSTL1, wherein, N180 and N144 glycosylations have been found to be critical for its function in cardiac tissue regeneration and pre-adipocyte differentiation, respectively. However, it is not known if PTMs other than glycosylation occurs in FSTL1 and how it impacts its pro-migratory function. Using in-silico analysis of mass spectrometric datasets, we found a novel PTM, namely, Serine 165 (S165) phosphorylation in FSTL1. To address the role of S165 phosphorylation in its pro-migratory function, a phosphorylation defective mutant of FSTL1 (S165A) was constructed by converting serine 165 to alanine and over expressed in 293T cells. S165A mutation did not affect the secretion of FSTL1 in vitro. However, S165A abolished the pro-migratory effect of FSTL1 in cultured keratinocytes likely via its inability to facilitate ERK signaling pathway. Interestingly, bacterially expressed recombinant FSTL1, trans-dominantly inhibited wound closure in keratinocytes highlighting the prime role of FSTL1 phosphorylation for its pro-migratory function. Further, under high glucose conditions, which inhibited scratchwound migration of keratinocytes, we noticed a significant decrease in S165 phosphorylation. Taken together, our results reveal a hitherto unreported role of FSTL1 phosphorylation PTM with profound implications in wound healing.",2,diagnosis

38768690,"The integrated stress response in pancreatic development, tissue homeostasis, and cancer.","Present in all eukaryotic cells, the integrated stress response (ISR) is a highly coordinated signaling network that controls cellular behavior, metabolism and survival in response to diverse stresses. The ISR is initiated when any one of four stress sensing kinases (PERK, GCN2, PKR, HRI) becomes activated to phosphorylate the protein translation initiation factor eIF2α, shifting gene expression toward a comprehensive rewiring of cellular machinery to promote adaptation. While the ISR has been shown to play an important role in the homeostasis of multiple tissues, evidence suggests that it is particularly crucial for the development and ongoing health of the pancreas. Among the most synthetically dynamic tissues in the body, the exocrine and endocrine pancreas relies heavily on the ISR to rapidly adjust cell function to meet the metabolic demands of the organism. The hardwiring of the ISR into normal pancreatic functions and adaptation to stress may explain why it is a commonly utilized pro-oncogenic and therapy-resistance mechanism in both pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PanNETs). Here we review what is known about the key roles that the ISR plays in the development, homeostasis, and neoplasia of the pancreas.",2,diagnosis
38768659,Cost-Effectiveness of Diabetic Retinopathy Screening for Newly Diagnosed Type 2 Diabetic Patients: A Nationwide Population-based Propensity Score-Matched Cohort Study.,"This study investigated the association between the frequency of screening for diabetic retinopathy (DR) versus the development of DR and corresponding medical expenses among patients newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This longitudinal, population-based study used the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database (2004 to 2020) as a data source. Propensity score matching (PSM) (sex, age, comorbidities and concurrent medication use) was employed in the grouping of T2DM patients according to different frequency of DR screening. Outcome measures included the proportion of patients who developed DR, who received DR treatment, and the associated medical expenses and hospitalizations. The 17-year cohort included 337,046 patients. After PSM, three groups each containing 35,739 patients were assembled and analyzed. Compared to low-frequency screening, high-frequency screening was more effective in detecting patients requiring treatment; however, the net cost for treatment was significantly lower. Standard-frequency screening appears to provide the best balance in terms of DR detection, diagnosis interval, the risk of DR-related hospitalization, and DR treatment costs. In this real-world cohort study covering all levels of the healthcare system, infrequent screening was associated with delayed diagnosis and elevated treatment costs, while a fundus screening interval of 1-2 years proved optimal in terms of detection and medical expenditures.",1,diagnosis
38768620,Effect of SGLT2 inhibitors on heart failure outcomes and cardiovascular death across the cardiometabolic disease spectrum: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have been studied in patients with heart failure, type 2 diabetes, chronic kidney disease, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and acute myocardial infarction. Individual trials were powered to study composite outcomes in one disease state. We aimed to evaluate the treatment effect of SGLT2 inhibitors on specific clinical endpoints across multiple demographic and disease subgroups. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we queried online databases (PubMed, Cochrane CENTRAL, and SCOPUS) up to Feb 10, 2024, for primary and secondary analyses of large trials (n>1000) of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with heart failure, type 2 diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (including acute myocardial infarction). Outcomes studied included composite of first hospitalisation for heart failure or cardiovascular death, first hospitalisation for heart failure, cardiovascular death, total (first and recurrent) hospitalisation for heart failure, and all-cause mortality. Effect sizes were pooled using random-effects models. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42024513836. We included 15 trials (N=100 952). Compared with placebo, SGLT2 inhibitors reduced the risk of first hospitalisation for heart failure by 29% in patients with heart failure (hazard ratio [HR] 0·71 [95% CI 0·67-0·77]), 28% in patients with type 2 diabetes (0·72 [0·67-0·77]), 32% in patients with chronic kidney disease (0·68 [0·61-0·77]), and 28% in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (0·72 [0·66-0·79]). SGLT2 inhibitors reduced cardiovascular death by 14% in patients with heart failure (HR 0·86 [95% CI 0·79-0·93]), 15% in patients with type 2 diabetes (0·85 [0·79-0·91]), 11% in patients with chronic kidney disease (0·89 [0·82-0·96]), and 13% in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (0·87 [0·78-0·97]). The benefit of SGLT2 inhibitors on both first hospitalisation for heart failure and cardiovascular death was consistent across the majority of the 51 subgroups studied. Notable exceptions included acute myocardial infarction (22% reduction in first hospitalisation for heart failure; no effect on cardiovascular death) and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (26% reduction in first hospitalisation for heart failure; no effect on cardiovascular death). SGLT2 inhibitors reduced heart failure events and cardiovascular death in patients with heart failure, type 2 diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. These effects were consistent across a wide range of subgroups within these populations. This supports the eligibility of a large population with cardiorenal-metabolic diseases for treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors. None.",2,treatment
38768613,Nutritional Challenges and Treatment After Bariatric Surgery.,"Bariatric surgery is an important weight loss tool in individuals with severe obesity. It is currently the most effective long-term weight loss treatment that lowers obesity-related comorbidities.

Recognizing the urgent need for effective solutions, it is crucial to develop suitable scaffolds specifically tailored for diabetic wound healing. In line with this objective, we have developed novel hybrid nanofibrous scaffolds by combining polyvinyl alcohol/chitosan (PVA/CS) and gelatin/poly(Ɛ-caprolactone) (Gel/PCL) polymers through a double-nozzle electrospinning technique. In this study, we investigated the influence of the Gel/PCL blend ratio on the properties of the resulting nanofibers. Three different hybrid scaffold structures were examined: Gel/PCL (80:20)-PVA/CS (80:20), Gel/PCL (50:50)-PVA/CS (80:20), and Gel/PVA (20:80)-PVA/CS (80:20). Our findings demonstrate that the electrospun nanofibers of PVA/CS (80:20)-Gel/PCL (80:20) exhibited optimal mechanical performance, with a contact angle of approximately 54° and a diameter of 183 nm. Considering the crucial role of inhibiting bacterial adhesion in the success of implanted materials, we evaluated the cytocompatibility of the hybrid electrospun nanofibers using mouse fibroblast cells (L-929 cells). The in vitro cytotoxicity results obtained from L-929 fibroblast cell culture on the hybrid scaffolds revealed enhanced cell proliferation and appropriate cell morphology on the PVA/CS (80:20)-Gel/PCL (80:20) sample, indicating its capability to support tissue cell integration. Based on the information obtained from this study, the fabricated hybrid scaffold holds great promise for diabetic ulcer healing. Its optimal mechanical properties, suitable contact angle, and favorable cytocompatibility highlight its potential as a valuable tool in the field of diabetic wound healing. The development of such hybrid scaffolds represents a significant step forward in addressing the challenges associated with diabetic wound care.&#xD.",2,diagnosis
38768555,Placental human papillomavirus infections and adverse pregnancy outcomes.,"Knowledge on prevalence and association of human papillomavirus (HPV) in third trimester placentae and adverse pregnancy outcomes is limited. We investigated the prevalence of placental HPV at delivery, explored urine HPV characteristics associated with placental HPV and whether placental HPV increased the risk adverse pregnancy outcomes. Pregnant women were enrolled in the Scandinavian PreventADALL mother-child cohort study at midgestation. Human papillomavirus genotyping was performed on placental biopsies collected at delivery (n = 587) and first-void urine at midgestation and delivery (n = 556). Maternal characteristics were collected by questionnaires at gestational week 18 and 34. Adverse pregnancy outcomes were registered from chart data including hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, gestational diabetes mellitus and newborns small for gestational age. Uni- and multivariable regression models were used to investigate associations. Placental HPV was detected in 18/587 (3 %). Twenty-eight genotypes were identified among the 214/556 (38 %) with midgestational urine HPV. Seventeen of the 18 women with placental HPV were midgestational HPV positive with 89 % genotype concordance. Midgestational high-risk-(HR)-HPV and high viral loads of Any- or HR-HPV were associated with placental HPV. Persisting HPV infection from midgestation to delivery was not associated with placental HPV. Adverse pregnancy outcomes were seen in 2/556 (0.4 %) of women with placental HPV. In this general cohort of pregnant women, the prevalence of placental HPV was 3 %, and midgestational urinary HPV 38 %. High HPV viral load increased the risk for placental HPV infections.

38769599,Research progress on the role of extracellular vesicles in the pathogenesis of diabetic kidney disease.,"Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is a serious complication of diabetes mellitus (DM) and has become the main cause of end-stage renal disease worldwide. In recent years, with the increasing incidence of DM, the pathogenesis of DKD has received increasing attention. The pathogenesis of DKD is diverse and complex. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) contain cell-derived membrane proteins, nucleic acids (such as DNA and RNA) and other important cellular components and are involved in intercellular information and substance transmission. In recent years, an increasing number of studies have confirmed that EVs play an important role in the development of DKD. The purpose of this paper is to explain the potential diagnostic value of EVs in DKD, analyze the mechanism by which EVs participate in intercellular communication, and explore whether EVs may become drug carriers for targeted therapy to provide a reference for promoting the implementation and application of exosome therapy strategies in clinical practice.",2,diagnosis
38769592,Long-term renal and cardiovascular risks of tacrolimus in patients with lupus nephritis.,"Despite continuous advancement, treatment of lupus nephritis (LN) remains challenging. Recent guidelines now include a regimen incorporating tacrolimus as a first-line treatment option. Even though tacrolimus is effective in combination with mycophenolate and corticosteroids, concerns remain regarding long-term use, given its association with increased cardiovascular risks including nephrotoxicity, hypertension, dyslipidemia and hyperglycemia in kidney transplant recipients. However, in LN, long-term evaluations and head-to-head comparisons are lacking and thus the safety profile remains ill-defined. We hypothesized that chronic toxicity also occurs in LN patients. Therefore, this study aimed to assess long-term cardiovascular and renal outcomes of tacrolimus in LN patients. This observational cohort study examined adult LN patients treated with tacrolimus, assessing renal outcomes, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, cardiovascular events and the Framingham risk score. The results were compared to a control group of CNI-naïve LN patients. Of the 219 LN patients in this study, 43 (19.6%) had tacrolimus exposure. Over a median follow-up of 7.1 years, tacrolimus use was associated with significant kidney function decline (6.8 ml/min/1.73m2, versus 0.8 in the control group). The incidence of end-stage kidney disease was similar. Cardiovascular event incidence was equally low in both groups. The 10-year risk of coronary heart disease was lower in the tacrolimus group, primarily due to age differences. HbA1c levels were higher in the tacrolimus group (37.4 mmol/mol) than in controls (33.6 mmol/mol), although the incidence of diabetes was similar. There were no differences in the occurrence of hypertension or dyslipidemia. Our study demonstrated that tacrolimus exposure was associated with long-term kidney function loss in LN patients. Although cardiovascular risk factors and events were similar to patients never exposed to tacrolimus, there may be an increased risk of developing diabetes. Therefore, our study supports vigilance towards renal adverse effects in LN patients treated with tacrolimus.",2,diagnosis
38769575,Type 2 diabetes in latin America: recommendations on the flash glucose monitoring system.,"To establish recommendations through the consensus of a Latin American experts panel on the use of the flash glucose monitoring system (fCGM) in people living with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) regarding the benefits and challenges of using the fCGM. An executive committee of experts was created, comprised by a panel of fifteen physicians, including endocrinologists and internal medicine physicians, with expertise in management of adult patients with T2DM. The experts were from various countries: Colombia, Chile, Peru, Mexico, Argentina, and Brazil. The modified Delphi method was used, considering a consensus level of at least 80% of the participants. A seventeen-item instrument was developed to establish recommendations on the use of fCGM in patients with T2DM in Latin American. The number of glucose scans recommended per day with the fCGM for patients managed with oral antidiabetic drugs or basal insulin was a median of 6 scans per day, and for those managed with multiple insulin doses, a median of 10 scans per day was recommended. Additionally, a holistic and individualized management approach was recommended, taking into account new treatment directions and identifying patients who would benefit from the use of the fCGM. Continuous use of the fCGM is recommended for people living with T2DM, regardless of their type of treatment. These metrics must be evaluated individually for each patient profile.",2,diagnosis
38769570,Hypopituitarism with secondary adrenocortical insufficiency and arginine vasopressin deficiency due to hypophysitis after COVID-19 vaccination: a case report.,"Although vaccination against coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has several side effects, hypopituitarism due to hypophysitis has rarely been reported. An 83-year-old healthy woman, who had received her fourth COVID-19 vaccine dose 2 days before admission, presented to the emergency department with difficulty moving. On examination, impaired consciousness (Glasgow Coma Scale: 14) and fever were observed. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of the head revealed swelling from the sella turcica to the suprasellar region. Her morning serum cortisol level was low (4.4 μg/dL) and adrenocorticotropic hormone level was normal (21.6 pg/mL). Central hypothyroidism was also suspected (thyroid stimulating hormone, 0.46 μIU/mL; free triiodothyronine, 1.86 pg/mL; free thyroxine, 0.48 ng/dL). Secondary adrenocortical insufficiency, growth hormone deficiency, delayed gonadotropin response, and elevated prolactin levels were also observed. After administration of prednisolone and levothyroxine, her consciousness recovered. On the 7th day of admission, the patient developed polyuria, and arginine vasopressin deficiency was diagnosed using a hypertonic saline test. On the 15th day, the posterior pituitary gland showed a loss of high signal intensity and the polyuria resolved spontaneously. On the 134th day, the corticotropin-releasing hormone loading test showed a normal response; however, the thyrotropin-releasing hormone stimulation test showed a low response. The patient's disease course was stable with continued thyroid and adrenal corticosteroid supplementation. Herein, we report a rare case of anterior hypopituitarism and arginine vasopressin deficiency secondary to hypophysitis following COVID-19 vaccination.",2,treatment
38769562,Association of prediabetes with clinical outcomes in patients with chronic coronary syndrome: a post hoc analysis of the ISCHEMIA and ISCHEMIA-CKD trials.,"There is conflicting evidence whether prediabetes is associated with adverse clinical outcomes in patients with chronic coronary syndrome. We aimed to assess the effect of prediabetes in patients with chronic coronary syndrome on clinical outcomes. This is a secondary analysis of data from the ISCHEMIA and ISCHEMIA-CKD trials, including patients with chronic coronary syndrome determined by coronary computed tomography angiography or exercise-stress testing. Participants were assigned to the normoglycemia group (HbA1c < 5.7% [< 39 mmol/mol]), prediabetes group (HbA1c 5.7-6.4% [40-47 mmol/mol]), or diabetes group (HbA1c ≥ 6.5% [≥ 48 mmol/mol]). The primary end point of this study was all-cause mortality. Secondary endpoints included major adverse cardiovascular events and composites thereof. Overall, the primary endpoint all-cause mortality occurred in 330 (8.4%) of 3910 patients over a median follow-up time of 3.1 years (IQR 2.1-4.1). The primary endpoint all-cause mortality occurred in 37 (5.2%) of 716 patients in the normoglycemia group, in 63 (6.9%) of 911 in the prediabetes group, and in 230 (10.1%) of 2283 in the diabetes group. In the covariate-adjusted Cox model analysis, the estimated adjusted HR (aHR) in the prediabetes group as compared with the normoglycemia group was 1.45 (95%CI, 0.95-2.20). The aHR in the diabetes group as compared with the normoglycemia group was 1.84 (95%CI, 1.29-2.65). Prediabetes, compared with normoglycemia, was associated with an increased risk of stroke (aHR, 3.44, 95%CI, 1.15-10.25). Subgroup analyses suggested an increased risk of all-cause death associated with prediabetes in males and patients under 65 years. In patients with chronic coronary syndrome, diabetes but not prediabetes was associated with significantly increased risk of all-cause death within a median follow-up period of 3.1 years.

38769550,"HbA1c changes in a deprived population who followed or not a diabetes self-management programme, organised in a multi-professional primary care practice: a historical cohort study on 207 patients between 2017 and 2019.","Diabetes self-management (DSM) helps people with diabetes to become actors in their disease. Deprived populations are particularly affected by diabetes and are less likely to have access to these programmes. DSM implementation in primary care, particularly in a multi-professional primary care practice (MPCP), is a valuable strategy to promote care access for these populations. In Rennes (Western France), a DSM programme was designed by a MPCP in a socio-economically deprived area. The study objective was to compare diabetes control in people who followed or not this DSM programme. The historical cohort of patients who participated in the DSM programme at the MPCP between 2017 and 2019 (n = 69) was compared with patients who did not participate in the programme, matched on sex, age, diabetes type and place of the general practitioner's practice (n = 138). The primary outcome was glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) change between 12 months before and 12 months after the DSM programme. Secondary outcomes included modifications in diabetes treatment, body mass index, blood pressure, dyslipidaemia, presence of microalbuminuria, and diabetes retinopathy screening participation. HbA1c was significantly improved in the exposed group after the programme (p < 0.01). The analysis did not find any significant between-group difference in socio-demographic data, medical history, comorbidities, and treatment adaptation. These results, consistent with the international literature, promote the development of DSM programmes in primary care settings in deprived areas. The results of this real-life study need to be confirmed on the long-term and in different contexts (rural area, healthcare organisation).",2,diagnosis
38769546,Analysis of causes and prognostic impact of tube occlusion during hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy for appendiceal pseudomyxoma peritonei.,"Appendiceal pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP), a rare tumor from mucinous appendiceal origins, is treated with Cytoreductive Surgery (CRS) and Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy (HIPEC). However, tubing blockages during HIPEC treatment pose a common challenge, impeding the smooth progression of therapy. Few studies to date have explored the incidence and risk factors of tube occlusion during HIPEC in patients with appendiceal PMP, as well as its adverse impact on postoperative complications. From October 2017 to June 2023, a total of 80 patients with appendiceal PMP undergoing combined CRS and HIPEC were included in this study. Tubing blockage events were strictly defined, with patients experiencing blockages during HIPEC treatment allocated to the study group, while those with unobstructed perfusion were assigned to the control group. A comparative analysis was conducted between the two groups regarding post-HIPEC health assessments and occurrence of complications. Risk factors for luminal occlusion during closed HIPEC procedures were identified through univariate and multivariate analysis of data from 303 HIPEC treatments. Tubing blockages occurred in 41 patients (51.3%). The study group experienced prolonged gastrointestinal decompression time (4.1 ± 3.0 vs. 2.5 ± 1.7 days, P = 0.003) and prolonged time to bowel movement (6.1 ± 2.3 vs. 5.1 ± 1.8 days, P = 0.022) compared to the control group. There was no significant difference in the incidence of complications between the two groups. The 1-year survival rate postoperatively was 97%, and the 3-year survival rate was 81%, with no association found between tubing blockage and poorer survival. Additionally, In 303 instances of HIPEC treatment among these 80 patients, tube occlusion occurred in 89 cases (89/303, 29.4%). Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed age, diabetes, hypertension, and pathology as independent risk factors for tube occlusion. Tubing blockages are a common occurrence during HIPEC treatment, leading to prolonged postoperative gastrointestinal functional recovery time. When patients are elderly and have concomitant hypertension and diabetes, along with a histological type of low-grade mucinous tumor, the risk of tube occlusion increases. However, this study did not find a significant correlation between tubing blockage and the incidence of postoperative complications or overall patient survival.",2,diagnosis
38769533,The quality of reporting in case reports of permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus: a cross-sectional study.,"Although randomized trials and systematic reviews provide the best evidence to guide medical practice, many permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus (PNDM) studies have been published as case reports. However, the quality of these studies has not been assessed. The purpose of this study was to assess the extent to which the current case reports for PNDM comply with the Case Report (CARE) guidelines and to explore variables associated with the reporting. Six English and four Chinese databases were searched from their inception to December 2022 for PNDM case reports. The 23 items CARE checklist was used to measure reporting quality. Primary outcome was the adherence rate of each CARE item and second outcome was total reporting score for each included PNDM case report. Linear and logistic regression analyses were used to examine the connection between five pre-specified predictor variables and the reporting quality. The predictor variables were impact factor of the published journal (<3.4 vs. ≥3.4, categorized according to the median), funding (yes vs. no), language (English vs. other language), published journal type (general vs. special) and year of publication (>2013 vs. ≤ 2013). In total, 105 PNDM case reports were included in this study. None of the 105 PNDM case reports fulfilled all 23 items of the CARE checklist. The response rate of 11 items were under 50%, including prognostic characteristics presentation (0%), patient perspective interpretation (0%), diagnostic challenges statement (2.9%), clinical course summary (21.0%), diagnostic reasoning statement (22.9%), title identification (24.8%), case presentation (33.3%), disease history description (34.3%), strengths and limitations explanation (41.0%), informed consent statement (45.7%), and lesson elucidation (47.6%). This study identified that the PNDM case reports published in higher impact factor journals were statistically associated with a higher reporting quality. The reporting of case reports for PNDM is generally poor. As a result, this information may be misleading to providers, and the clinical applications may be detrimental to patient care. To improve reporting quality, journals should encourage strict adherence to the CARE guidelines.",2,diagnosis
38769523,ABO and Rhesus blood groups and multiple health outcomes: an umbrella review of systematic reviews with meta-analyses of observational studies.,"Numerous studies have been conducted to investigate the relationship between ABO and Rhesus (Rh) blood groups and various health outcomes. However, a comprehensive evaluation of the robustness of these associations is still lacking. We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane, and several regional databases from their inception until Feb 16, 2024, with the aim of identifying systematic reviews with meta-analyses of observational studies exploring associations between ABO and Rh blood groups and diverse health outcomes. For each association, we calculated the summary effect sizes, corresponding 95% confidence intervals, 95% prediction interval, heterogeneity, small-study effect, and evaluation of excess significance bias. The evidence was evaluated on a grading scale that ranged from convincing (Class I) to weak (Class IV). We assessed the certainty of evidence according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation criteria (GRADE). We also evaluated the methodological quality of included studies using the A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR). AMSTAR contains 11 items, which were scored as high (8-11), moderate (4-7), and low (0-3) quality. We have gotten the registration for protocol on the PROSPERO database (CRD42023409547). The current umbrella review included 51 systematic reviews with meta-analysis articles with 270 associations. We re-calculated each association and found only one convincing evidence (Class I) for an association between blood group B and type 2 diabetes mellitus risk compared with the non-B blood group. It had a summary odds ratio of 1.28 (95% confidence interval: 1.17, 1.40), was supported by 6870 cases with small heterogeneity (I<sup>2</sup> = 13%) and 95% prediction intervals excluding the null value, and without hints of small-study effects (P for Egger's test > 0.10, but the largest study effect was not more conservative than the summary effect size) or excess of significance (P < 0.10, but the value of observed less than expected). And the article was demonstrated with high methodological quality using AMSTAR (score = 9). According to AMSTAR, 18, 32, and 11 studies were categorized as high, moderate, and low quality, respectively. Nine statistically significant associations reached moderate quality based on GRADE. Our findings suggest a potential relationship between ABO and Rh blood groups and adverse health outcomes. Particularly the association between blood group B and type 2 diabetes mellitus risk.",2,diagnosis

The aim of this study is to investigate the factors that influence the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of patients with T2D. This study conducted using data from 6th phase (2015-2017) and 7th phase (2018-2022) of the Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study (TLGS). Data were collected through a combination of interviews, physical examinations, and laboratory tests. Quality of life questionnaire (SF-12) that consists of 12 questions was used to assess physical and mental health functioning. The generalized estimating equation model was used to assess the association between socio-behavioral factors and changes in HRQoL. The study included 498 patients with T2D. The changes in HRQoL in patients with T2D followed a sex-specific pattern. Analysis of the physical component score (PCS) and the mental component score (MCS) showed a non-significant change in the total score during the three-year longitudinal study. However, the role physical (RP) of the PCS and the social functioning (SF) of the MCS showed a statistically significant change during this period. In addition, sex, body mass index (BMI), and having cardiovascular disease (CVD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) showed a significant association with RP changes, and only job status showed a significant association with SF changes. By recognizing the sex-specific patterns in HRQoL changes and understanding the multifaceted nature of factors such as BMI, CVD and CKD, healthcare professionals can develop targeted interventions that go beyond traditional diabetes management.",2,diagnosis
38769500,Glomerular crescents are associated with the risk of type 2 diabetic kidney disease progression: a retrospective cohort study.,"Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) stands as the predominant cause of chronic kidney disease and end-stage kidney disease. Its diverse range of manifestations complicates the treatment approach for patients. Although kidney biopsy is considered the gold standard for diagnosis, it lacks precision in predicting the progression of kidney dysfunction. Herein, we addressed whether the presence of glomerular crescents is linked to the outcomes in patients with biopsy-confirmed type 2 DKD. We performed a retrospective evaluation, involving 327 patients diagnosed with biopsy-confirmed DKD in the context of type 2 diabetes, excluding cases with other glomerular diseases, from nine tertiary hospitals. Hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated using a Cox regression model to assess the risk of kidney disease progression, defined as either ≥ 50% decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rates or the development of end-stage kidney disease, based on the presence of glomerular crescents. Out of the 327 patients selected, ten patients had glomerular crescents observed in their biopsied tissues. Over the follow-up period (median of 19 months, with a maximum of 18 years), the crescent group exhibited a higher risk of kidney disease progression than the no crescent group, with an adjusted HR of 2.82 (1.32-6.06) (P = 0.008). The presence of heavy proteinuria was associated with an increased risk of developing glomerular crescents. The presence of glomerular crescents is indeed linked to the progression of type 2 DKD. Therefore, it is important to determine whether there is an additional immune-mediated glomerulonephritis requiring immunomodulation, and it may be prudent to monitor the histology and repeat a biopsy.",1,diagnosis
38769477,"Air pollution, life's essential 8, and risk of severe non-alcoholic fatty liver disease among individuals with type 2 diabetes.","The impacts of long-term exposure to air pollution on the risk of subsequent non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) among participants with type 2 diabetes (T2D) is ambiguous. The modifying role of Life's Essential 8 (LE8) remains unknown. This study included 23,129 participants with T2D at baseline from the UK Biobank. Annual means of nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>X</sub>), and particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>2.5-10</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>) were estimated using the land-use regression model for each participant. The associations between exposure to air pollution and the risk of severe NAFLD were evaluated using Cox proportional hazard models. The effect modification of LE8 was assessed through stratified analyses. During a median 13.6 years of follow-up, a total of 1,123 severe NAFLD cases occurred. After fully adjusting for potential covariates, higher levels of PM<sub>2.5</sub> (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.12, 95%CI:1.02, 1.23 per interquartile range [IQR] increment), NO<sub>2</sub> (HR = 1.15, 95%CI:1.04, 1.27), and NO<sub>X</sub> (HR = 1.08, 95%CI:1.01, 1.17) were associated with an elevated risk of severe NAFLD. In addition, LE8 score was negatively associated with the risk of NAFLD (HR = 0.97, 95% CI: 0.97, 0.98 per point increment). Compared with those who had low air pollution and high LE8, participants with a high air pollution exposure and low LE8 had a significantly higher risk of severe NAFLD. Our findings suggest that long-term exposure to air pollution was associated with an elevated risk of severe NAFLD among participants with T2D. A lower LE8 may increase the adverse impacts of air pollution on NAFLD.",2,treatment
38769435,Transcriptional control of metabolism by interferon regulatory factors.,"Interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) comprise a family of nine transcription factors in mammals. IRFs exert broad effects on almost all aspects of immunity but are best known for their role in the antiviral response. Over the past two decades, IRFs have been implicated in metabolic physiology and pathophysiology, partly as a result of their known functions in immune cells, but also because of direct actions in adipocytes, hepatocytes, myocytes and neurons. This Review focuses predominantly on IRF3 and IRF4, which have been the subject of the most intense investigation in this area. IRF3 is located in the cytosol and undergoes activation and nuclear translocation in response to various signals, including stimulation of Toll-like receptors, RIG-I-like receptors and the cGAS-STING pathways. IRF3 promotes weight gain, primarily by inhibiting adipose thermogenesis, and also induces inflammation and insulin resistance using both weight-dependent and weight-independent mechanisms. IRF4, meanwhile, is generally pro-thermogenic and anti-inflammatory and has profound effects on lipogenesis and lipolysis. Finally, new data are emerging on the role of other IRF family members in metabolic homeostasis. Taken together, data indicate that IRFs serve as critical yet underappreciated integrators of metabolic and inflammatory stress.",2,diagnosis
38769420,Functional canonical RNAi in mice expressing a truncated Dicer isoform and long dsRNA.,"Canonical RNA interference (RNAi) is sequence-specific mRNA degradation guided by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) made by RNase III Dicer from long double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). RNAi roles include gene regulation, antiviral immunity or defense against transposable elements. In mammals, RNAi is constrained by Dicer's adaptation to produce another small RNA class-microRNAs. However, a truncated Dicer isoform (ΔHEL1) supporting RNAi exists in mouse oocytes. A homozygous mutation to express only the truncated ΔHEL1 variant causes dysregulation of microRNAs and perinatal lethality in mice. Here, we report the phenotype and canonical RNAi activity in Dicer<sup>ΔHEL1/wt</sup> mice, which are viable, show minimal miRNome changes, but their endogenous siRNA levels are an order of magnitude higher. We show that siRNA production in vivo is limited by available dsRNA, but not by Protein kinase R, a dsRNA sensor of innate immunity. dsRNA expression from a transgene yields sufficient siRNA levels to induce efficient RNAi in heart and muscle. Dicer<sup>ΔHEL1/wt</sup> mice with enhanced canonical RNAi offer a platform for examining potential and limits of mammalian RNAi in vivo.",2,diagnosis
38769364,A dynamic probabilistic model of the onset and interaction of cardio-metabolic comorbidities on an ageing adult population.,"Comorbidity is widespread in the ageing population, implying multiple and complex medical needs for individuals and a public health burden. Determining risk factors and predicting comorbidity development can help identify at-risk subjects and design prevention strategies. Using socio-demographic and clinical data from approximately 11,000 subjects monitored over 11 years in the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, we develop a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) to model the onset and interaction of three cardio-metabolic comorbidities, namely type 2 diabetes (T2D), hypertension, and heart problems. The DBN allows us to identify risk factors for developing each morbidity, simulate ageing progression over time, and stratify the population based on the risk of outcome occurrence. By applying hierarchical agglomerative clustering to the simulated, dynamic risk of experiencing morbidities, we identified patients with similar risk patterns and the variables contributing to their discrimination. The network reveals a direct joint effect of biomarkers and lifestyle on outcomes over time, such as the impact of fasting glucose, HbA1c, and BMI on T2D development. Mediated cross-relationships between comorbidities also emerge, showcasing the interconnected nature of these health issues. The model presents good calibration and discrimination ability, particularly in predicting the onset of T2D (iAUC-ROC = 0.828, iAUC-PR = 0.294) and survival (iAUC-ROC = 0.827, iAUC-PR = 0.311). Stratification analysis unveils two distinct clusters for all comorbidities, effectively discriminated by variables like HbA1c for T2D and age at baseline for heart problems. The developed DBN constitutes an effective, highly-explainable predictive risk tool for simulating and stratifying the dynamic risk of developing cardio-metabolic comorbidities. Its use could help identify the effects of risk factors and develop health policies that prevent the occurrence of comorbidities.",0,prevention
38769347,Self-supervised learning of accelerometer data provides new insights for sleep and its association with mortality.,"Sleep is essential to life. Accurate measurement and classification of sleep/wake and sleep stages is important in clinical studies for sleep disorder diagnoses and in the interpretation of data from consumer devices for monitoring physical and mental well-being. Existing non-polysomnography sleep classification techniques mainly rely on heuristic methods developed in relatively small cohorts. Thus, we aimed to establish the accuracy of wrist-worn accelerometers for sleep stage classification and subsequently describe the association between sleep duration and efficiency (proportion of total time asleep when in bed) with mortality outcomes. We developed a self-supervised deep neural network for sleep stage classification using concurrent laboratory-based polysomnography and accelerometry. After exclusion, 1448 participant nights of data were used for training. The difference between polysomnography and the model classifications on the external validation was 34.7 min (95% limits of agreement (LoA): -37.8-107.2 min) for total sleep duration, 2.6 min for REM duration (95% LoA: -68.4-73.4 min) and 32.1 min (95% LoA: -54.4-118.5 min) for NREM duration. The sleep classifier was deployed in the UK Biobank with 100,000 participants to study the association of sleep duration and sleep efficiency with all-cause mortality. Among 66,214 UK Biobank participants, 1642 mortality events were observed. Short sleepers (<6 h) had a higher risk of mortality compared to participants with normal sleep duration of 6-7.9 h, regardless of whether they had low sleep efficiency (Hazard ratios (HRs): 1.58; 95% confidence intervals (CIs): 1.19-2.11) or high sleep efficiency (HRs: 1.45; 95% CIs: 1.16-1.81). Deep-learning-based sleep classification using accelerometers has a fair to moderate agreement with polysomnography. Our findings suggest that having short overnight sleep confers mortality risk irrespective of sleep continuity.",2,diagnosis
38769300,Integrating single cell expression quantitative trait loci summary statistics to understand complex trait risk genes.,"Transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) is a popular approach to dissect the functional consequence of disease associated non-coding variants. Most existing TWAS use bulk tissues and may not have the resolution to reveal cell-type specific target genes. Single-cell expression quantitative trait loci (sc-eQTL) datasets are emerging. The largest bulk- and sc-eQTL datasets are most conveniently available as summary statistics, but have not been broadly utilized in TWAS. Here, we present a new method EXPRESSO (EXpression PREdiction with Summary Statistics Only), to analyze sc-eQTL summary statistics, which also integrates 3D genomic data and epigenomic annotation to prioritize causal variants. EXPRESSO substantially improves existing methods. We apply EXPRESSO to analyze multi-ancestry GWAS datasets for 14 autoimmune diseases. EXPRESSO uniquely identifies 958 novel gene x trait associations, which is 26% more than the second-best method. Among them, 492 are unique to cell type level analysis and missed by TWAS using whole blood. We also develop a cell type aware drug repurposing pipeline, which leverages EXPRESSO results to identify drug compounds that can reverse disease gene expressions in relevant cell types. Our results point to multiple drugs with therapeutic potentials, including metformin for type 1 diabetes, and vitamin K for ulcerative colitis.",2,diagnosis
38769296,Production of deoxycholic acid by low-abundant microbial species is associated with impaired glucose metabolism.,"Alterations in gut microbiota composition are suggested to contribute to cardiometabolic diseases, in part by producing bioactive molecules. Some of the metabolites are produced by very low abundant bacterial taxa, which largely have been neglected due to limits of detection. However, the concentration of microbially produced metabolites from these taxa can still reach high levels and have substantial impact on host physiology. To explore this concept, we focused on the generation of secondary bile acids by 7α-dehydroxylating bacteria and demonstrated that addition of a very low abundant bacteria to a community can change the metabolic output dramatically. We show that Clostridium scindens converts cholic acid into the secondary bile acid deoxycholic acid (DCA) very efficiently even though the abundance of C. scindens is low, but still detectable by digital droplet PCR. We also show that colonization of germ-free female mice with a community containing C. scindens induces DCA production and affects host metabolism. Finally, we show that DCA correlates with impaired glucose metabolism and a worsened lipid profile in individuals with type 2 diabetes, which implies that this metabolic pathway may contribute to the development of cardiometabolic disease.",2,diagnosis
38769291,First report of anthracnose of <i>Lithocarpus polystachyus</i> caused by <i>Colletotrichum fructicola</i> in China.,"Lithocarpus polystachyus (Wall. ex A. DC.), an economically valuable plant species belonging to the Fagaceae family, has been used as herbal tea to prevent diabetes because of the high content of flavonoids and dihydrochalcones in the leaves (Shang et al. 2022). In July 2022, the severe leaf lesion on L. polystachyus was first observed in Yongshun County, Xiangxi autonomous prefecture (28°45'34''N, 109°40'11''E), Hunan province, China. Yongshun County is characterized by hills and mountains, situated in a subtropical region with a mild and humid climate. A second outbreak in July 2023 was observed in the same area. The observed incident rates in the past two years were 87.3% and 90.6%, respectively. Once infected, almost all plant leaves will be infected, leading to a substantial reduction in the yield of L. polystachyus. The disease presented symptoms characterized by round or irregularly shaped lesions that initially manifested as brown spots. These lesions frequently merged into larger, dark-brown areas along the leaf margins before eventually wilting. To ascertain the pathogenic species responsible for this disease, fungal isolation was conducted using a tissue separation method (Xu et al. 2023). The infected leaf tissues were surface-disinfected with 75% ethanol and 0.1% HgCl then small pieces (1×1 cm), were placed onto potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium (Sigma-Aldrich, 70139) and incubated at 28°C for 6-9 days. Colonies were villiform and initially white, becoming gray after 6 days. Sterilized dissecting needles were used to pick single hyphal tips from the edge of the colonies and placed onto PDA for strain purification. After 15 days, the purified colonies grew fluffy white hyphae with abundant conidia. The conidia were cylindrical, had round ends, and ranged from 5.75 to 14.83 μm long and 1.75 to 2.38 μm wide (n=50). According to morphological and cultural characteristics, these isolates were preliminarily identified as Colletotrichum fructicola Prihast., L. Cai & K.D. Hyde (Damm et al. 2012). To further affirm the identity of the pathogen, DNA was extracted from mycelia using a DNA extraction kit (Sigma-Aldrich, G2N70). The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, the transcription elongation factor (TEF), and the actin (ACT) gene were then amplified from genomic DNA extracted from three isolates (Cof1, Cof2, and Cof3) using specific primers. The primers utilized were ITS1/ITS4 (White et al. 1990), EF1-728F/EF1-986R and ACT-512F/ACT-783R (Carbone and Kohn 1999) for ITS region, transcription elongation factor gene and actin gene amplification, respectively. Sequence identity indicated that these isolates were highly homologous to C. fructicola. The ITS (Genbank No. PP002156, OR880553 and OR880554), TEF (No. PP061421, PP061422 and PP061423), and ACT (No. PP061418, PP061419 and PP061420) sequences of the isolates Cof1, Cof2, and Cof3 shared 99 to 100% identity with their counterparts (No. OR083309, MF627961, and OQ427895) in C. fructicola, respectively. A neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree constructed using MEGA11 (Tamura et al. 2021) also indicated that these isolates were C. fructicola. Both morphological and molecular characteristics confirmed the identification of this pathogen as C. fructicola. Colletotrichum species are known to cause anthracnose disease in a variety of economically important crops (Sharma and Kulshrestha 2015). To further validate the ability of the isolated C. fructicola to induce the same symptoms as observed in the field, the pathogenicity assay was assessed following Koch's postulates (Gradmann, 2014). Conidial suspensions (1×105 conidia per mL) from three isolates were individually inoculated onto artificially wounded leaves of 3-year-old L. polystachyus. Negative controls were established by inoculating leaf wounds with sterile distilled water. The plants were incubated in a greenhouse at 28°C and 90% humidity with a 12-h photoperiod. The experiment was replicated three times. Necrotic lesions were observed on all pathogen-inoculated wounds within 6 days after inoculation, whereas controls showed no observable symptoms. Morphological and molecular characterization of re-isolated pathogens from infected leaves indicated that the pathogens were identical. To our knowledge, this is the first report of anthracnose of L. polystachyus caused by C. fructicola in China. Farmers in the local mountainous areas are economically reliant on L. polystachyus production, while anthracnose has caused over half of the trees to lose their commercial value, resulting in significant economic losses. Our findings hold great promise for advancing strategies in the prevention and treatment of anthracnose in L. polystachyus.",0,prevention
38769229,"Impact of etiology, sex, diabetes mellitus and remission status on erythrocytic profile in patients with cushing's syndrome: a large population database study.","The study aimed to characterize the erythrocytic profile in patients with cushing's syndrome (CS) versus controls from the normal population according to etiology, sex, presence of diabetes mellitus (DM) and hypercortisolemia remission status. This retrospective cohort analysis compared erythrocytic parameters between patients with CS of pituitary (CD) and adrenal (aCS) etiology and age, sex, body mass index (BMI) and socioeconomic status-matched controls in a 1:5 ratio. Laboratory values at baseline were calculated as mean values during the year preceding CS diagnosis, and over one year thereafter. The cohort included 397 CS patients (68.26% female; mean age 51.11 ± 16.85 years) and 1970 controls. Patients with CS had significantly higher baseline median levels of hemoglobin (Hgb) (13.70 g/dL vs. 13.12 g/dL [p < 0.0001]) and hematocrit (Hct) (41.64% vs. 39.80% [p < 0.0001]) compared to controls. These differences were observed for both CD and aCS and for both sexes. Patients who attained remission had Hgb and Hct levels comparable to controls (13.20 g/dL and 40.08% in patients with CD and aCS vs. 13.20 g/dL and 39.98% in controls). Meanwhile, those with persistent/recurrent disease maintained elevated levels. Patients with comorbid DM had similar Hgb but higher Hct (p = 0.0419), while patients without DM showed elevated erythrocytic values compared to controls (p < 0.0001). Our data illustrates that erythrocytic parameters are directly influenced by glucocorticoid excess as Hgb and Hct are higher in patients with CS, and normalize after remission. We have identified the influence of DM on erythrocytic parameters in patients with CS for the first time.",1,diagnosis
38769223,"Formulation of Saxagliptin Oral Films: Optimization, Physicochemical Characterization, In-Vivo Assessment, and In-Vitro Real-Time Release Monitoring via a Novel Polyaniline Nanoparticles-Based Solid-Contact Screen Printed Ion-Selective Electrode.","Oral dispersible films have received broad interest due to fast drug absorption and no first-path metabolism, leading to high bioavailability and better patient compliance. Saxagliptin (SXG) is an antidiabetic drug that undergoes first-path metabolism, resulting in a less active metabolite, so the development of SXG oral dispersible films (SXG-ODFs) improves SXG bioavailability. The formula optimisation included a response surface experimental design and the impact of three formulation factors, the type and concentration of polymer and plasticiser concentration on in-vitro disintegration time and folding endurance. Two optimised SXG-ODFs prepared using either polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) or hydroxypropyl methylcellulose were investigated. SXG-ODFs prepared with PVA demonstrated a superior rapid disintegration time, ranging from 17 to 890 s, with the fastest disintegration time recorded at 17 s. These short durations can be attributed to the hydrophilic nature of PVA, facilitating rapid hydration and disintegration upon contact with saliva. Additionally, PVA-based films displayed remarkable folding endurance, surpassing 200 folds without rupture, indicating flexibility and stability. The high tensile strength of PVA-based films further underscores their robust mechanical properties, with tensile strength values reaching up to 4.53 MPa. SXG exhibits a UV absorption wavelength of around 212 nm, posing challenges for traditional quantitative spectrophotometric analysis, so a polyaniline nanoparticles-based solid-contact screen-printed ion-selective electrode (SP-ISE) was employed for the determination of SXG release profile effectively in comparison to HPLC. SP-ISE showed a better real-time release profile of SXG-ODFs, and the optimised formula showed lower blood glucose levels than commercial tablets.",2,diagnosis

This cross-sectional study involved 938 hospitalized patients with T2DM. Linear regression models were used to explore the relationship between DHEA and DHEAS and the BMD at different skeletal sites. Multinominal logistic regression models and the restricted cubic spline (RCS) were used to evaluate the associations of DHEA and DHEAS with the risks of osteopenia and/or osteoporosis. In postmenopausal women with T2DM, after adjustment for confounders including testosterone and estradiol, DHEA showed a significant positive correlation with lumbar spine BMD (P = 0.013). Moreover, DHEAS exhibited significant positive correlations with BMD at three skeletal sites: including femoral neck, total hip, and lumbar spine (all P < 0.05). Low DHEA and DHEAS levels were associated with increased risk of osteopenia and/or osteoporosis (all P < 0.05) and the risk of osteoporosis gradually decreased with increasing DHEAS levels (P overall = 0.018, P-nonlinear = 0.559). However, DHEA and DHEAS levels in men over the age of 50 with T2DM were not associated with any of above outcomes. In patients with T2DM, independent of testosterone and estradiol, higher DHEA and DHEAS levels are associated with higher BMD and lower risk of osteopenia/osteoporosis in postmenopausal women but not men over the age of 50.",2,diagnosis
38769135,Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index is associated with adverse outcomes in patients with hypertension: the Fukushima Cohort study.,"Malnutrition is reportedly associated with adverse clinical outcomes in various populations. However, associations between nutritional status and adverse outcomes in patients with hypertension have not been sufficiently elucidated. We therefore aimed to investigate the impact of nutritional status as evaluated by the Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index (GNRI) on adverse outcomes in patients with hypertension. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 1588 hypertensive patients enrolled in the Fukushima Cohort Study. Participants were categorized into tertiles (T1-T3) according to GNRI at baseline. The primary endpoint of the present study was a kidney event, defined as a combination of a 50% decline in eGFR from baseline and end-stage kidney disease requiring kidney replacement therapy. Associations between GNRI and kidney events were assessed using Kaplan-Meier curves and multivariate Cox regression analyses. Median age was 64 years, 55% were men, median eGFR was 63.1 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, and median GNRI was 101.3. The lower GNRI group (T1) showed an increased incidence of kidney events in the Kaplan-Meier curve analysis. Compared to the highest GNRI group (T3), lower GNRI carried a higher risk of kidney events for both T2 (hazard ratio [HR] 1.38, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.71-2.68) and T1 (HR 3.59, 95%CI 1.96-6.63). Similar relationships were observed for risks of all-cause death and cardiovascular events. Lower GNRI was associated with kidney events, all-cause death, and cardiovascular events in patients with hypertension. Nutritional status as evaluated by GNRI could offer a simple and useful predictor of adverse outcomes in this population.",2,diagnosis
38769127,Protein carbonylation causes sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload by increasing intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> level in ventricular myocytes.,"Diabetes is commonly associated with an elevated level of reactive carbonyl species due to alteration of glucose and fatty acid metabolism. These metabolic changes cause an abnormality in cardiac Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulation that can lead to cardiomyopathies. In this study, we explored how the reactive α-dicarbonyl methylglyoxal (MGO) affects Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulation in mouse ventricular myocytes. Analysis of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics revealed that MGO (200 μM) increases action potential (AP)-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca<sup>2+</sup> load, with a limited effect on L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients and SERCA-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake. At the same time, MGO significantly slowed down cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> extrusion by Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger (NCX). MGO also increased the frequency of Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves during rest and these Ca<sup>2+</sup> release events were abolished by an external solution with zero [Na<sup>+</sup>] and [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]. Adrenergic receptor activation with isoproterenol (10 nM) increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients and SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> load, but it also triggered spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves in 27% of studied cells. Pretreatment of myocytes with MGO increased the fraction of cells with Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves during adrenergic receptor stimulation by 163%. Measurements of intracellular [Na<sup>+</sup>] revealed that MGO increases cytosolic [Na<sup>+</sup>] by 57% from the maximal effect produced by the Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup> ATPase inhibitor ouabain (20 μM). This increase in cytosolic [Na<sup>+</sup>] was a result of activation of a tetrodotoxin-sensitive Na<sup>+</sup> influx, but not an inhibition of Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup> ATPase. An increase in cytosolic [Na<sup>+</sup>] after treating cells with ouabain produced similar effects on Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulation as MGO. These results suggest that protein carbonylation can affect cardiac Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulation by increasing cytosolic [Na<sup>+</sup>] via a tetrodotoxin-sensitive pathway. This, in turn, reduces Ca<sup>2+</sup> extrusion by NCX, causing SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload and spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves.",2,diagnosis

A retrospective cohort study was designed to analyse the data of 76 847 newborns, in which the case groups included 3042 cases of low birth weight (LBW) and 2941 cases of fetal macrosomia (MAC), and 70 864 cases of normal weight were as the reference group. The incidence of LBW and MAC was 3.96% and 3.83% in Hangzhou, China from 2015 to 2021. Prematurity (<37 weeks), multiple births, hospitalisation >7 days, fetal anomalies, caesarean section, pregnancy complications, maternal coinfection with pathogens and summer births would be correlated with the incidence of LBW (ORs=43.50, 7.60, 2.09, 1.89, 1.57, 1.28, 1.19 and 1.18, all p<0.05). Factors such as post-term pregnancy (>41 weeks), scarred uterus, anterior vaginal incision and gravidity ≥2 were correlated with decreased incidence of LBW, with ORs of 0.05, 0.54, 0.65 and 0.80. Moreover, caesarean delivery, post-term pregnancy (> 41 weeks), parity ≥1, lateral vaginal incision, gravidity ≥2, hospitalisation >7 days, winter births and pregnancy complications also have association with the incidence of MAC (ORs=3.92, 2.73, 2.19, 1.87, 1.22, 1.20, 1.17 and 1.13, all p<0.05) while prematurity (<37 weeks), scarred uterus and anterior vaginal incision have close association with decreased incidence of MAC, with ORs of 0.07, 0.21 and 0.74 (all p<0.05). There was a trend of yearly increase in ABW in Hangzhou, China from 2015 to 2021. Several neonatal and maternal-related variables such as caesarean section, pregnancy complications and hospitalisation >7 days are associated with the odds of LBW and MAC, however, factors such as pregnancy with scarred uterus relate to the decrease of ABW. Close monitoring and intervention during pregnancy are essential to reduce the occurrence of ABW.",2,treatment
38769035,Comprehensive outcomes after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass with a near-complete 15-year follow-up.,"Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass has a well-established safety and efficacy profile in the short and mid-term. Long-term outcomes remain limited in the literature, especially for follow-up periods of >10 years. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the long-term durability and safety of laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass over a near-complete 15-year follow-up. This is a single-center retrospective cohort study of patients who underwent primary laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass between 2008 and 2009 with ≥14-year follow-up. Data collected and analyzed were weight loss, obesity-related medical condition resolution and recurrence, weight recurrence, complication rate, and mortality rate. A total of 264 patients were included. Patients were predominantly female (81.8%), and the mean age and preoperative body mass index were 48.5 ± 12.2 years and 44.9 ± 7.3 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, respectively. The maximum mean percentage total weight loss achieved at 1 year was 31.5% ± 5.7% and was consistently >20% throughout follow-up. Sustained resolution of obesity-related medical conditions was achieved with a remission rate of 60.8% for type 2 diabetes mellitus, 46.7% for denoted dyslipidemia, and 40% for hypertension. Obesity-related medical condition recurrence was observed with a recurrence rate of 24.1% for type 2 diabetes mellitus, 17.9% for hypertension, and 14.8% for denoted dyslipidemia. Significant factors associated with weight loss were maximum percentage total weight loss and preoperative type 2 diabetes mellitus. Over 15 years, the weight recurrence rate was 51.1%, with predictors of higher preoperative body mass index and preoperative type 2 diabetes mellitus. Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass provides sustainable weight loss over a 15-year period, with consistent long-term weight-loss outcomes and resolution of obesity-related medical conditions sustained for ≥10 years after surgery.",2,diagnosis
38768417,Assessing Patterns of CGM use and Metrics of Glycemic Control in T1D and T2D Patients in the Veterans Healthcare System: Integrating CGM Device Data with EHR Data.,"To integrate long-term daily continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) device data with electronic health records (EHR) for type 1 and type 2 diabetes patients in the Veterans Affairs Healthcare System to assess real-world patterns of CGM use and the reliability of EHR-based CGM information. This observational study used Dexcom CGM device data linked with EHR (from 2015-2020) for a large national cohort of diabetes patients. We tracked the initiation and consistency of CGM use, assessed concordance of CGM use and measures of glucose control between CGM device data and EHR records, and examined results by age, ethnicity, and diabetes type. The time from pharmacy release of CGM to patients to initiation of uploading CGM data to Dexcom servers averaged three weeks but demonstrated wide variation among individuals; importantly, this delay decreased markedly over the later years. The average daily wear time of CGM exceeded 22 hours over nearly three years of follow-up. Patterns of CGM use were generally consistent across age, race/ethnicity groups and diabetes type. There was strong concordance between EHR-based estimates of CGM use and Dexcom CGM wear time and between estimates of glucose control from both sources. The study demonstrates our ability to reliably integrate CGM devices and EHR data to provide valuable insights into CGM use patterns. The results indicate in the real-world environment that CGM is worn consistently over many years for both type 1 and type 2 patients within the Veterans Affairs Healthcare System and is similar across major race/ethnicity and age groups.",2,diagnosis
38768416,Continuous glucose monitoring and recreational scuba diving in type 1 diabetes: head-to-head comparison between Free Style Libre 3 and Dexcom G7 performance.,"Background Scuba diving was previously excluded because of hypoglycemic risks for type 1 diabetic patients (T1DM). Specific eligibility criteria and a safety protocol have been defined, while continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems have enhanced diabetes management. This study aims to assess the feasibility and accuracy of CGM Dexcom G7 (DG7) and Free Style Libre 3 (FSL3) in a setting of repetitive scuba diving in T1DM, exploring the possibility of non-adjunctive use. Material and methods The study was conducted during an event of Diabete Sommerso® association in November 2023. Participants followed a safety protocol, with capillary glucose as reference standard (Beurer GL50Evo). Sensors accuracy was evaluated through Median and Mean Absolute Relative Difference (MeARD and MARD) and Surveillance Error Grid (SEG) Analysis. Sub-analyses were performed by glycemic range, timing, gender. Data distribution and correlation was estimated by Spearman test and Bland-Altman plots. The ability of sensors to identify hypoglycaemia was assessed by contingency tables. Participants completed a satisfation questionnaire. Results Data from 202 dives of 13 patients were collected. The overall MARD was 31% for DG7 and 14.2% for FSL3, MeARD 19.7% and 11.6% respectively. FSL3 exhibited better accuracy in normoglycemic and hyperglycemic ranges. SEG analysis showed 82.1% (DG7) and 97.4% (FSL3) data on no-risk zone. FSL3 better performed on hypoglycemia identification (diagnostic odds ratio of 254.10 vs 58.95). Neither of sensors reached the MARD for non-adjunctive use. Patient satisfaction favored FSL3 for size and minimal bulk, while DG7 received positive feedback for versatility. Conclusions The study reveals FSL3 superior accuracy compared to DG7 in a setting of repetitive scuba diving in T1DM, except for hypoglycemic range. Both sensors fails to achieve accuracy for non-adjunctive use. Capillary tests remain crucial for safe dive planning, and sensor data should be interpreted cautiously. We suggest exploring additional factors potentially influencing sensor performance.",2,diagnosis
38768366,Glucose Regulation of β-Cell KATP Channels: It Is Time for a New Model!,"An agreed-upon consensus model of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from healthy β-cells is essential for understanding diabetes pathophysiology. Since the discovery of the KATP channel in 1984, an oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos)-driven rise in ATP has been assumed to close KATP channels to initiate insulin secretion. This model lacks any evidence, genetic or otherwise, that mitochondria possess the bioenergetics to raise the ATP/ADP ratio to the triggering threshold, and conflicts with genetic evidence demonstrating that OxPhos is dispensable for insulin secretion. It also conflates the stoichiometric yield of OxPhos with thermodynamics, and overestimates OxPhos by failing to account for established features of β-cell metabolism, such as leak, anaplerosis, cataplerosis, and NADPH production that subtract from the efficiency of mitochondrial ATP production. We have proposed an alternative model, based on the spatial and bioenergetic specializations of β-cell metabolism, in which glycolysis initiates insulin secretion. The evidence for this model includes that 1) glycolysis has high control strength over insulin secretion; 2) glycolysis is active at the correct time to explain KATP channel closure; 3) plasma membrane-associated glycolytic enzymes control KATP channels; 4) pyruvate kinase has favorable bioenergetics, relative to OxPhos, for raising ATP/ADP; and 5) OxPhos stalls before membrane depolarization and increases after. Although several key experiments remain to evaluate this model, the 1984 model is based purely on circumstantial evidence and must be rescued by causal, mechanistic experiments if it is to endure.",2,diagnosis
38768365,Glucose Regulation of β-Cell KATP Channels: Is a New Model Needed?,"The canonical model of glucose-induced increase in insulin secretion involves the metabolism of glucose via glycolysis and the citrate cycle, resulting in increased ATP synthesis by the respiratory chain and the closure of ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channels. The resulting plasma membrane depolarization, followed by Ca2+ influx through L-type Ca2+ channels, then induces insulin granule fusion. Merrins and colleagues have recently proposed an alternative model whereby KATP channels are controlled by pyruvate kinase, using glycolytic and mitochondrial phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to generate microdomains of high ATP/ADP immediately adjacent to KATP channels. This model presents several challenges. First, how mitochondrially generated PEP, but not ATP produced abundantly by the mitochondrial F1F0-ATP synthase, can gain access to the proposed microdomains is unclear. Second, ATP/ADP fluctuations imaged immediately beneath the plasma membrane closely resemble those in the bulk cytosol. Third, ADP privation of the respiratory chain at high glucose, suggested to drive alternating, phased-locked generation by mitochondria of ATP or PEP, has yet to be directly demonstrated. Finally, the approaches used to explore these questions may be complicated by off-target effects. We suggest instead that Ca2+ changes, well known to affect both ATP generation and consumption, likely drive cytosolic ATP/ADP oscillations that in turn regulate KATP channels and membrane potential. Thus, it remains to be demonstrated that a new model is required to replace the existing, mitochondrial bioenergetics-based model.",2,diagnosis

The paucity of postgraduate medical education to invest in standardization of transgender health training sustains these barriers, leaving physicians feeling unprepared and averse to provide transgender health care. Closing this education gap and improving transgender healthcare necessitates the development of consensus-built transgender health objectives of training (THOOT), particularly in Adult Endocrinology and Metabolism Residency programs. We conducted a two-round modified-Delphi process involving a nationally representative panel of experts, including Adult Endocrinology and Metabolism program directors, physician content experts, residents, and transgender community members, to identify THOOT for inclusion in Canadian Endocrinology and Metabolism Residency programs. Participants used a 5-point Likert scale to assess THOOT importance for curricular inclusion, with opportunities for written feedback. Data was collected through Qualtrics and analyzed after each round. In the first Delphi round, panelists reviewed and rated 81 literature extracted THOOT, achieving consensus on all objectives. Following panelists' feedback, 5 THOOT were added, 9 removed, 34 consolidated into 12 objectives, and 47 were rephrased or retained. In the second Delphi round, panelists assessed 55 THOOT. Consensus was established for 8 THOOT. Program directors' post-Delphi feedback further consolidated objectives to arrive at 4 THOOT for curriculum inclusion. To our knowledge, this is the first time a consensus-based approach has been used to establish THOOT for any subspecialty postgraduate medicine program across Canada or the United States. Our results lay the foundation towards health equity and social justice in transgender health medical education, offering a blueprint for future innovations.",2,diagnosis

Our methodology compares the guideline's Asbru-based formal representation, including its intentions, with the longitudinal medical record, using a top-down and bottom-up approach. Partial matches are resolved using fuzzy temporal logic. The system was evaluated in the type 2 Diabetes management domain, comparing it to three expert clinicians, including two diabetes experts. The system and the experts commented on the management of 10 patients, randomly selected from 2,000 diabetes patients. On average, each record spanned 5.23 years; the data included 1,584 medical transactions. The system provided 279 comments. The experts made 181 different unique comments. The completeness (recall) of the system was 91% when the gold standard was comments made by at least two of the three experts, and 98%, compared to comments made by all three experts. The experts also assessed all of the 114 medication-therapy-related comments, and a random 35% of the 165 tests-and-monitoring-related comments. The system's correctness (precision) was 81%, compared to comments judged as correct by both diabetes experts, and 91%, compared to comments judged as correct by one diabetes expert and at least as partially correct by the other. 89% of the comments were judged as important by both diabetes experts, 8% were judged as important by one expert, and 3% were judged as less important by both experts. Adding the validated system comments to the experts' comments, the completeness scores of the experts were 75%, 60%, and 55%; the expert correctness scores were respectively 99%, 91%, and 88%. Thus, the system could be ranked first in completeness and second in correctness. We conclude that systems such as DiscovErr can effectively assess the quality of continuous guideline-based care.",2,diagnosis

People with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are at-risk of having low oral healthcare behavior and disease-related oral health. To investigate the oral health status and factors associated with oral healthcare behavior among people with T2DM in Thailand. In total, 401 people with T2DM participated in the study based on their attendance at a non-communicable disease clinic at sub-district health promotion hospitals in Bueng Kan, a north-eastern province in Thailand. A structured questionnaire was used to obtain variables of interest. Linear regression analysis at the 95% confidence interval (CI) was applied. The majority of participants were female (73.8%). More than three-quarters had more than 20 permanent teeth (77.6%), a decay missing filling tooth index was 10.6 teeth/person. Many participants had four permanent occlusal pairs (69.6%), had tooth decay (74.6%), and some participants had tooth filling (32.2%). Statistically significant factors associated with oral healthcare behavior were: having complications associated with diabetes mellitus (Beta = -0.097, 95%CI = -1.653, -0.046), oral health literacy (Beta = 0.119, 95%CI = 0.009, 0.150), educational level (Beta = 0.123, 95%CI = 0.103, 0.949), oral healthcare attitude (Beta = 0.258, 95%CI = 0.143, 0.333), and oral health services (Beta = 0.430, 95%CI = 0.298, 1.408).

38768141,"Prevalence of dyslipidemia, hypertension and diabetes among tribal and rural population in a south Indian forested region.","While NCDs are in rise globally, tribal and rural populations residing near to reserve forests with limited exposure to modern lifestyles may bear a unique burden. This study investigates the prevalence and risk factors of hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia among these communities. We conducted a cross-sectional study between 2018 and 2020 in the forest-dwelling population of Chamarajanagar, India. Using multistage stratified sampling based on caste and remoteness, we enrolled 608 participants aged over 18 years, including 259 non-tribal and 349 tribal individuals. Data collection includes the administration of STEPS questionnaire and measurement of fasting blood sugar, lipid levels, and blood pressure. The prevalence of diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia were 4.6%, 28.8%, and 85.7%, respectively, among the study population. We also found abnormal levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), Triglycerides (TGA), Total cholesterol (TC), and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)in 4.9%, 82.4%, 22.7%, 5.8%, and 7.4% of participants, respectively. Significant differences were observed in diabetes, LDL abnormality, TGA abnormality, VLDL abnormality, and TC abnormality, but not in hypertension, dyslipidemia, or HDL abnormality, across the Socio Geographic Discrimination Index. We found a significant difference in diabetes and HDL abnormality, but not in hypertension, dyslipidemia, LDL abnormality, TGA abnormality, TC abnormality, or VLDL abnormality, between tribal and non-tribal populations living in the forest-dwelling area. Waist circumference was a significant independent predictor of diabetes among tribal participants, while wealth index, age, and waist circumference were significant predictors of hypertension. There were no significant predictors for dyslipidemia among tribal participants. Our study suggests that tribal population living in a remote area are at a lower risk of developing diabetes compared to non-tribal populations living in the same geographic area. However, the prevalence of hypertension and dyslipidemia among tribal populations remains high and comparable to that of the general population.",2,diagnosis
38768125,Glucose Responsive Coacervate Protocells from Microfluidics for Diabetic Wound Healing.,"The hyperglycemic pathophysiological environment in diabetic wounds is a major obstacle that impedes the healing process. Glucose-responsive wound healing materials are a promising approach to address this challenge. In this study, complex coacervate-based protocells are introduced for diabetic wound healing. By employing a microfluidic chip with an external mechanical vibrator, uniform coacervate microdroplets are generated via electrostatic interactions between diethylaminoethyl-dextran and double-stranded DNA. The spontaneous assembly of a phospholipid membrane on the droplet surface enhances its biocompatibility. Glucose oxidase and copper peroxide nanodots are integrated into microdroplets, enabling a glucose-responsive cascade that produces hydroxyl radicals as antibacterial agents. These features contribute to efficient antibacterial activity and wound healing in diabetic mice. The present protocells facilitate intelligent wound management, and the design of cascade catalytic coacervates can contribute to the development of various smart vehicles for drug delivery.",2,diagnosis
38768121,"Exploring the path to optimal diabetes care by unravelling the contextual factors affecting access, utilisation, and quality of primary health care in West Africa: A scoping review protocol.","The prevalence of diabetes in West Africa is increasing, posing a major public health threat. An estimated 24 million Africans have diabetes, with rates in West Africa around 2-6% and projected to rise 129% by 2045 according to the WHO. Over 90% of cases are Type 2 diabetes (IDF, World Bank). As diabetes is ambulatory care sensitive, good primary care is crucial to reduce complications and mortality. However, research on factors influencing diabetes primary care access, utilisation and quality in West Africa remains limited despite growing disease burden. While research has emphasised diabetes prevalence and risk factors in West Africa, there remains limited evidence on contextual influences on primary care. This scoping review aims to address these evidence gaps. Using the established methodology by Arksey and O'Malley, this scoping review will undergo six stages. The review will adopt the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Extension for Scoping Review (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines to ensure methodological rigour. We will search four electronic databases and search through grey literature sources to thoroughly explore the topic. The identified articles will undergo thorough screening. We will collect data using a standardised data extraction form that covers study characteristics, population demographics, and study methods. The study will identify key themes and sub-themes related to primary healthcare access, utilisation, and quality. We will then analyse and summarise the data using a narrative synthesis approach. The findings and conclusive report will be finished and sent to a peer-reviewed publication within six months. This review protocol aims to systematically examine and assess the factors that impact the access, utilisation, and standard of primary healthcare services for diabetes in West Africa.",2,diagnosis
38768080,"A national audit of facilities, human and material resources for the comprehensive management of diabetes in Ghana-A 2023 update.","The human and material resources as well as the systems for managing diabetes in Africa are inadequate. This study or needs assessment, aimed at updating the human and material resources, identifying the gaps and unmet needs for comprehensive diabetes care in Ghana. We conducted a national audit of 122 facilities in all 16 administrative regions of Ghana. Information obtained covered areas on personnel and multidisciplinary teams, access to medications, access to laboratory services, financing, screening services, management of diabetes complications, and availability/use of diabetes guidelines or protocols. Data was analysed using STATA version 16.1. P-values <0.05 were set as significant. Only 85(69.7%) out of the 122 surveyed facilities had a dedicated centre or service for diabetes care. Twenty-eight (23%) had trained diabetes doctors/specialists; and whilst most centres had ophthalmic nurses and dieticians, majority of them did not have trained diabetes educators (nurses), psychologists, ophthalmologists, podiatrists, and foot/vascular surgeons. Also, 13.9% had monofilaments, none could perform urine dipstick for microalbumin; 5 (4.1%) and just over 50% could perform laboratory microalbumin estimation and glycated haemoglobin, respectively. Access to and supply of human insulins was better than analogue insulin in most centres. Nearly 100% of the institutions surveyed had access to metformin and sulphonylurea with good to excellent supply in most cases, whilst access to Sodium Glucose Transporter-2 inhibitors and Glucagon-like peptide-1 analogues were low, and moderate for Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors and thiazolidinediones. Majority of the health facilities (95.1%) offered NHIS as payment mechanism for clients, whilst 68.0% and 30.3% of the patients paid for services using out-of-pocket and private insurance respectively. Fifteen facilities (12.3%) had Diabetes Support Groups in their locality and catchment areas. An urgent multisectoral collaboration, including prioritisation of resources at the facility level, to promote and achieve acceptable comprehensive diabetes care is required.",2,diagnosis
38768058,Metabolic dysregulation in obese women and the carcinogenesis of gynecological tumors: A review.,"Obesity is a significant health issue associated with increased cancer risks, including gynecological malignancies. The worldwide rise in obesity rates is significantly impacting both cancer development and treatment outcomes. Adipose tissue plays a crucial role in metabolism, secreting various substances that can influence cancer formation. In obese individuals, dysfunctional adipose tissue can contribute to cancer development through inflammation, insulin resistance, hormonal changes, and abnormal cholesterol metabolism. Studies have shown a strong correlation between obesity and gynecological cancers, particularly endometrial and breast cancers. Obesity not only increases the risk of developing these cancers but is also associated with poorer outcomes. Additionally, obesity affects the perioperative management of gynecological cancers, requiring specialized care due to increased complications and resistance to therapy. Treatment strategies for managing metabolic dysregulation in patients with gynecological cancers include weight management, statin therapy, and insulin-sensitizing medications. Emerging studies suggest that interventions like intermittent fasting and caloric restriction may enhance the effectiveness of cancer treatments. Furthermore, targeting cholesterol metabolism, such as with statins or proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors, shows potential in cancer therapy. In conclusion, addressing metabolic issues, particularly obesity, is crucial in preventing and treating gynecological malignancies. Personalized approaches focusing on weight management and metabolic reprogramming may improve outcomes in these patients.",2,diagnosis
38768051,Fractures in Patients With Diabetes Mellitus: Findings From a 20-year Registry at a Single Level 1 Trauma Center.,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a risk factor of infection. Although DM has been associated with worse functional outcomes after acetabular fracture, literature regarding the effect of DM on surgical site infection and other early complications is lacking. A 20-year registry from a level 1 trauma center was queried to identify 134 patients with DM and 345 nondiabetic patients with acetabular fractures. The diabetic patient population was older (57.2 versus 43.2; P < 0.001) and had higher average body mass index (33.6 versus 29.5; P < 0.001). Eighty-three patients with DM and 270 nondiabetics were treated surgically (62% versus 78%; P < 0.001). Diabetic patients who were younger (54.6 versus 61.4; P = 0.01) with fewer comorbidities (1.7 versus 2.2; P = 0.04) were more frequently managed surgically. On univariate analysis, patients with DM more commonly developed any early infection (28.4% versus 21%; P = 0.049) but were no more likely to develop surgical site infection, or other postoperative complications. Older patient age, length of stay, baseline pulmonary disease, and concurrent abdominal injury were independent predictors of postoperative infection other than surgical site infection. Diabetics that developed infection had more comorbidities (2.4 versus 1.5; P < 0.001) and higher Injury Severity Score (24.1 versus 15.8; P = 0.003), and were more frequently insulin-dependent (72.7% versus 41%; P = 0.01). Independent of management strategy, diabetic patients were more likely to develop an infection after acetabular fracture. Insulin dependence was associated with postoperative infection on univariate analysis. Optimal selection of surgical candidates among patients with DM may limit postoperative infections.",2,treatment
38767891,Factors associated to hemoglobin decrease after percutaneous nephrolithotomy: a retrospective study.,"This study aims to determine the preoperative and perioperative risk parameters associated with a decrease in hemoglobin (Hb) in patients undergoing percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL). We collected prospective data of consecutive patients who underwent PCNL from January 2018 to December 2022. The median decrease in post-operative hemoglobin levels compared to pre-operative was found to be 1.5 g/dl. This value was the cut-off value that divided the sample into two groups. Group 1 has a decrease in Hb levels that is higher or equal to the cutoff, group 2 has a decrease in Hb levels that is lower than the cut-off. All preoperative, stone characteristics and perioperative factors were recorded. A total of 273 patients were included in the study, 141 in Group 1 and 132 in Group 2. The mean age of Group 1 was significantly higher (55.48 ± 8.73 vs 45.9 ± 10.75 years, p < 0.05). The mean bleeding of Group 1 was significantly higher (285.85 ± 113.68 vs 135 ± 77.54 ml, p < 0.05). There was a significant difference in mean operation time between groups (86.35 ± 32.05 vs 64.89 ± 27.83 min, p < 0.05). Multivariate analysis showed that the variables age, comorbid diabetes mellitus, intraoperative bleeding amount, and operation time had a significant relationship with Hb reduction in patients undergoing PCNL (p < 0.05). Older age, comorbid diabetes mellitus, large amounts of intraoperative bleeding, and longer operating time are factors associated with PCNL-related postoperative hemoglobin decrease.",2,diagnosis
38767850,"CLINICAL CHARACTERIZATION OF AQUEOUS AND VITREOUS RETINOL-BINDING PROTEIN 3 CONCENTRATIONS IN RELATION TO DIABETIC RETINOPATHY SEVERITY, RETINAL STRUCTURES, AND SYSTEMIC COMPLICATIONS.","To evaluate Retinol-Binding Protein 3 (RBP3) from photoreceptors in aqueous and its association with vitreous concentrations, diabetic retinopathy (DR) severity, retinal layer thickness, and clinical characteristics in people with diabetes. RBP3 concentration was measured by custom-developed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in aqueous and correlated with vitreous concentrations in patients from the 50-Year Medalist study and Beetham Eye Institute at Joslin Diabetes Center. Aqueous RBP3 concentration (N = 131) was elevated in eyes with no to mild DR (mean ± SD 0.7 nM ± 0.2) and decreased in eyes with moderate to severe DR (0.65 nM ± 0.3) and proliferative DR (0.5 nM ± 0.2, P < 0.001) compared to eyes without diabetes. Aqueous and vitreous RBP3 concentrations correlated with each other (r = 0.34, P = 0.001) and between fellow eyes (P < 0.0001). History of retinal surgery did not affect aqueous RBP3 concentrations, but cataract surgery affected both vitreous and aqueous levels. Elevated aqueous RBP3 concentration associated with increased thickness of the outer nuclear layer (P = 0.004) and correlated with hemoglobin A1c, whereas vitreous RBP3 concentrations correlated with diabetic systemic complications. These findings suggest that aqueous RBP3 concentration may be an important endogenous clinical retinal protective factor, a biomarker for DR severity, and a promising VEGF-independent clinical intervention target in DR.",2,diagnosis
38767849,ASSOCIATION OF MACULAR STRUCTURE WITH MICROPERIMETRY SENSITIVITY FOLLOWING VITRECTOMY FOR PROLIFERATE DIABETIC RETINOPATHY.,"To evaluate macular sensitivity using microperimetry in patients with proliferate diabetic retinopathy following vitrectomy and to investigate the relationship between the sensitivity and foveal microstructures with optical coherence tomography/angiography. Eighty-four eyes of 84 patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy, who were indicated for vitrectomy, had no intraocular surgery history 3 months preoperatively, and were able to ensure fundus examination after the vitrectomy, were included. A logMAR best-corrected visual acuity, macular sensitivity of microperimetry, macular retinal thickness, and macular vessel perfusion using optical coherence tomography/angiography were examined at 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months postoperatively. The logMAR best-corrected visual acuity and mean macular sensitivity of patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy improved postoperatively (P < 0.05). There was a significant correlation between best-corrected visual acuity and mean sensitivity (P < 0.05). Postoperative mean macular sensitivity was significantly correlated with outer retinal thickness in the 0 to 6 mm macular area (P < 0.05) and also significantly correlated with deep capillary plexus perfusion (P < 0.05). Fixation stability and mean macular sensitivity did not show any correlation with glycated hemoglobin, triglyceride, serum total cholesterol, carbamide, and creatinine and duration of diabetes mellitus (P > 0.05). Postoperative mean macular sensitivity was significantly correlated with outer retinal thickness and deep capillary plexus perfusion for patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy. The authors found that the visual performance of patients can be evaluated by the outer retinal thickness and deep capillary plexus perfusion, so optical coherence tomography/angiography examination can be an important prognostic factor for visual performance in patients.Clinical Trial Registration: This trial is registered with the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (http://www.chictr.org.cn; Registration No.: ChiCTR2100043399).",2,diagnosis
38767826,Dietary Modulations in Preventing Cardiometabolic Risk in Individuals with Type 2 Diabetes.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a complex health issue include obesity, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and chronic inflammation that increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). CVDs are of great concern in the disease progression and prognosis of T2DM. This review is a comprehensive examination of the literature on the relationship between T2DM and cardiovascular risk, nutrition-related cardiometabolic risk (CMR) factors, and impact of dietary modulations on CMR. In recent years the researches has been focus on the importance of a comprehensive treatment approach like dietary modulations to address multiple cardiovascular risk reductions, including hypertension and dyslipidemia. Modulation of dietary patterns are the most promising interventions to prevent CMR factors and T2DM via affecting the body weight, glucose control, and microbial diversity of individuals. Current evidence suggests that high-quality dietary patterns such as the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan and the Mediterranean diet is important in the metabolic control processes of T2DM with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant compounds, glucagon-like peptide agonist compounds, and intestinal microbiota changes. Nutrition plays a critical role in preventing and improving CVD outcomes in patients with T2DM. Dietary modulations should be planned considering individual differences in responses to dietary composition and nutritional changes, personal preferences, eating behaviors and gut microbiota differences.",2,diagnosis
38767746,Food Insecurity and Hypoglycemia among Older Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Treated with Insulin or Sulfonylureas: The Diabetes & Aging Study.,"Severe hypoglycemia is a serious adverse drug event associated with hypoglycemia-prone medications; older patients with diabetes are particularly at high risk. Economic food insecurity (food insecurity due to financial limitations) is a known risk factor for hypoglycemia; however, less is known about physical food insecurity (due to difficulty cooking or shopping for food), which may increase with age, and its association with hypoglycemia. Study associations between food insecurity and severe hypoglycemia. Survey based cross-sectional study. Survey responses were collected in 2019 from 1,164 older (≥ 65 years) patients with type 2 diabetes treated with insulin or sulfonylureas. Risk ratios (RR) for economic and physical food insecurity associated with self-reported severe hypoglycemia (low blood glucose requiring assistance) adjusted for age, financial strain, HbA1c, Charlson comorbidity score and frailty. Self-reported reasons for hypoglycemia endorsed by respondents. Food insecurity was reported by 12.3% of the respondents; of whom 38.4% reported economic food insecurity only, 21.1% physical food insecurity only and 40.5% both. Economic food insecurity and physical food insecurity were strongly associated with severe hypoglycemia (RR = 4.3; p = 0.02 and RR = 4.4; p = 0.002, respectively). Missed meals (""skipped meals, not eating enough or waiting too long to eat"") was the dominant reason (77.5%) given for hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia prevention efforts among older patients with diabetes using hypoglycemia-prone medications should address food insecurity. Standard food insecurity questions, which are used to identify economic food insecurity, will fail to identify patients who have physical food insecurity only.",0,prevention
38767740,Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease and Ethnicity: Lessons Learned from the Arab Population in Israel.,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common liver disease. We aimed to investigate the potential similarities and differences regarding the disease among Arabs and Jews. Retrospective study included all patients older than 18 years with NAFLD diagnosis according to ICD-10 codes. Data regarding demographics, comorbidities, and outcomes were retrieved using the MdClone platform from ""Clalit"" in Israel. Data concerning 34,090 Arab patients and 173,500 Jewish patients with NAFLD were included. Arab patients were significantly younger at diagnosis (35.0 ± 13 years vs. 43.6 ± 15 years, p < 0.001) and had higher rates of obesity and diabetes mellitus (69.5% vs. 56.5% and 27.0% vs. 22.7%, p < 0.001, respectively). Arab patients had higher rates of cirrhosis and portal hypertension-related complications (2.5% vs. 2.0%, p < 0.001), esophageal varices (0.9% vs. 0.5%, p < 0.001), spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (0.3% vs. 0.1%, p < 0.001), and hepatorenal syndrome (0.3% vs. 0.1%, p < 0.001). There was no significant difference in the prevalence of hepatocellular carcinoma between study groups (0.4% vs. 0.5%, p = 0.156). Liver transplantation was performed in 0.2% of Arab NAFLD patients compared to 0.07% of Jewish NAFLD patients (p < 0.001). Lower rates of all-cause mortality were found among the Arab NAFLD patients versus Jewish NAFLD patients (7.7% versus 11.5%, p < 0.001). According to the Cox regression model, Arab ethnicity is a risk factor for death with OR of 1.36. Significant differences regarding comorbidities, complications, liver transplantations rates, and all-cause mortality were found among NAFLD patients of different ethnicities, hence specific population need specific consideration in prevention, early diagnosis and follow up.",0,prevention
38767687,High body mass index and triglyceride levels at health checkups increase the risk of new-onset chronic kidney disease and worsening renal function: the TAMA MED Project-CKD.,"Health checkups are important in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), which is not easily accompanied by subjective symptoms. CKD can be caused or aggravated by factors that have not yet been identified. This retrospective cohort study included 7 483 patients who underwent specific annual health checkups at a medical institution in Tama City, did not have CKD in 2012, and continued to undergo checkups (aged 40-74 years). We examined the risk factors for new-onset CKD and 1.5-fold increase in serum creatinine levels among laboratory values from 2012 to 2020. Age, body mass index (BMI), triglyceride levels, atrial fibrillation, and medication for hypertension (HT) and diabetes mellitus were independent risk factors for proteinuria, whereas current smoking, BMI, systolic blood pressure (SBP), and medication for HT were independent risk factors for estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>. SBP, triglyceride levels and medication for HT were risk factors for a 1.5-fold increase in serum creatinine levels during course of the study. The cut-off values of BMI for eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> were 22.2 (men 24.7, women 22.1) kg/m<sup>2</sup> and fasting triglyceride levels for a 1.5-fold increase in serum creatinine level were 171 (men 247, women 170) mg/dL, respectively. Health checkups provide information to prevent new-onset CKD and worsening of renal function. It is necessary to increase the rate of health checkups and visits to medical institutions after health checkups as well as to use these results for health guidance.",2,treatment
38767675,Open questions on basal insulin therapy in T2D: a Delphi consensus.,"The revolution in the therapeutic approach to type 2 diabetes (T2D) requires a rethinking of the positioning of basal insulin (BI) therapy. Given the considerable number of open questions, a group of experts was convened with the aim of providing, through a Delphi consensus method, practical guidance for doctors. A group of 6 experts developed a series of 29 statements on: the role of metabolic control in light of the most recent guidelines; BI intensification strategies: (1) add-on versus switch; (2) inertia in starting and titrating; (3) free versus fixed ratio combination; basal-bolus intensification and de-intensification strategies; second generation analogues of BI (2BI). A panel of 31 diabetologists, by accessing a dedicated website, assigned each statement a relevance score on a 9-point scale. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method was adopted to assess the existence of disagreement among participants. Panelists showed agreement for all 29 statements, of which 26 were considered relevant, one was considered not relevant and two were of uncertain relevance. Panelists agreed that the availability of new classes of drugs often allows the postponement of BI and the simplification of therapy. It remains essential to promptly initiate and titrate BI when required. BI should always, unless contraindicated, be started in addition to, and not as a replacement, for ongoing treatments with cardiorenal benefits. 2BIs should be preferred for their pharmacological profile, greater ease of self-titration and flexibility of administration. In a continuously evolving scenario, BI therapy still represents an important option in the management of T2D patients.",2,diagnosis
38767674,Assessment of genetic and clinical factors in T2D susceptibility among patients with hypertension.,"Hypertension (HTN) and Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) often coexist, therefore understanding the relationship between both diseases is imperative to guide targeted prevention/therapy. This study aims to explore the relationship between HTN and T2D using genome-wide association study (GWAS) analysis and biochemical data to understand the implication of both clinical and genetic factors in these pathologies. A total of 2,876 patients were enrolled. Using GWAS and biochemical data, patients with both T2D and HTN were compared to patients with only HTN. Specificity was confirmed by testing the detected genetic variants for associations with HTN development in T2D patients, or with HTN in healthy subjects. Regression models were applied to examine the association of T2D in patients with HTN with cardiovascular risk factors. Replication was performed using UK Biobank dataset with 31,170 subjects. Data showed that females with HTN are at higher risk of developing T2D due to dyslipidemia, while males faced higher risk due to high BMI (body mass index) and family history of T2D. GWAS identified Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) linked to T2D in patients with HTN. Notably, rs7865889, rs7756992, and rs10896290 were positively associated with T2D, whereas rs12737517 yielded negative association. Three SNPs were replicated in the UK Biobank (rs10896290, rs7865889, and rs7756992). Incorporating clinical and genetic screening into risk assessment is important for the detection and prevention of T2D in patients with HTN. The detected SNPs (rs7865889, rs12737517, and rs10896290), especially the protective SNP (rs12737517), provide an opportunity for better diagnosis, prevention, and therapy of patients with T2D and HTN.",0,prevention
38767646,Characteristics and quality of clinical practice guidelines for diabetic kidney disease: a systematic review.,"To assess the quality of Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) in the context of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) and determine whether any factors affect the quality. We searched eight databases along with five international and national organizations to develop or archive guidelines from their inception to July 2023, with an additional search of medlive.cn. And the authoritative organizations related to nephrology. CPGs and consensus statements created using direct differential diagnosis or therapy for DKD were included without language restrictions. Their quality was evaluated by four reviewers using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation Ⅱ (AGREE Ⅱ) instrument. Along with the item and domain scores, the guideline was also allocated an overall quality score, which ranged from 1 (lowest possible quality) to 7 (highest possible quality). Moreover, an overall recommendation for use was also assigned (""recommended"", ""recommended with modifications"" or ""not recommended""). A total of 16 CPGs were included, of which 14 were from Asia and the remaining two from Europe. These two CPGs were updated in the third version. Six CPGs were recommended for use because their primary domains scored in the medium or high category. Furthermore, five CPGs were recommended with modifications as the stakeholder involvement, applicability, and editorial independence domains were evaluated as low categories. In all domains, the lowest average score was for rigour of development (33%), followed by application (36%), and stakeholder involvement (51%). The highest average score was for scope and purpose (79%), followed by clarity of presentation (75%). None of the CPGs considered the patient's viewpoint, and six of 16 CPGs did not use any grading system to translate the evidence into recommendations. Additionally, only three of 16 CPGs shared search strategy, and eight of 16 CPGs did not declare a funding source. According to the AGREE II evaluation, more than one in four CPGs for DKD had poor methodological quality. Enhanced efforts are needed to advance the rigour of development, application, and editorial independence of DKD guideline panels for most guidelines. Stakeholders, CPG developers, and CPG users should consider methodological quality while choosing CPGs, and interpret and implement their issued suggestions.",1,diagnosis

38767572,Proteasome gene expression is controlled by coordinated functions of multiple transcription factors.,"Proteasome activity is crucial for cellular integrity, but how tissues adjust proteasome content in response to catabolic stimuli is uncertain. Here, we demonstrate that transcriptional coordination by multiple transcription factors is required to increase proteasome content and activate proteolysis in catabolic states. Using denervated mouse muscle as a model system for accelerated proteolysis in vivo, we reveal that a two-phase transcriptional program activates genes encoding proteasome subunits and assembly chaperones to boost an increase in proteasome content. Initially, gene induction is necessary to maintain basal proteasome levels, and in a more delayed phase (7-10 days after denervation), it stimulates proteasome assembly to meet cellular demand for excessive proteolysis. Intriguingly, the transcription factors PAX4 and α-PALNRF-1 control the expression of proteasome among other genes in a combinatorial manner, driving cellular adaptation to muscle denervation. Consequently, PAX4 and α-PALNRF-1 represent new therapeutic targets to inhibit proteolysis in catabolic diseases (e.g., type-2 diabetes, cancer).",2,diagnosis
38767441,"Efficacy and Safety of Sirolimus-Eluting Stent with Biodegradable Polymer Ultimaster™ in Unselected Korean Population: A Multicenter, Prospective, Observational Study From Korean Multicenter Ultimaster Registry.","Ultimaster™, a third-generation sirolimus-eluting stent using biodegradable polymer, has been introduced to overcome long term adverse vascular events, such as restenosis or stent thrombosis. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the 12-month clinical outcomes of Ultimaster™ stents in Korean patients with coronary artery disease. This study is a multicenter, prospective, observational registry across 12 hospitals. To reflect real-world clinical evidence, non-selective subtypes of patients and lesions were included in this study. The study end point was target lesion failure (TLF) (the composite of cardiac death, target vessel myocardial infarction [MI], and target lesion revascularization [TLR]) at 12-month clinical follow up. A total of 576 patients were enrolled between November 2016 and May 2021. Most of the patients were male (76.5%), with a mean age of 66.0±11.2 years. Among the included patients, 40.1% had diabetes mellitus (DM) and 67.9% had acute coronary syndrome (ACS). At 12 months, the incidence of TLF was 4.1%. The incidence of cardiac death was 1.5%, MI was 1.0%, TLR was 2.7%, and stent thrombosis was 0.6%. In subgroup analysis based on the presence of ACS, DM, hypertension, dyslipidemia, or bifurcation, there were no major differences in the incidence of the primary endpoint. The present registry shows that Ultimaster™ stent is safe and effective for routine real-world clinical practice in non-selective Korean patients, having a low rate of adverse events at least up to 12 months.",2,diagnosis
38767438,Augmenter of liver regeneration knockout aggravates tubular ferroptosis and macrophage activation by regulating carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1A-induced lipid metabolism in diabetic nephropathy.,"Ferroptosis is a novel type of programmed cell death that performs a critical function in diabetic nephropathy (DN). Augmenter of liver regeneration (ALR) exists in the inner membrane of mitochondria, and inhibits inflammation, apoptosis, and oxidative stress in acute kidney injury; however, its role in DN remains unexplored. Here, we aimed to identify the role of ALR in ferroptosis induction and macrophage activation in DN. The expression of ALR was examined in DN patients, db/db DN mice, and HK-2 cells treated with high glucose (HG). The effects of ALR on ferroptosis and macrophage activation were investigated with ALR conditional knockout, lentivirus transfection, transmission electron microscopy, qRT-PCR and western blotting assay. Mass spectrometry and rescue experiments were conducted to determine the mechanism of ALR. ALR expression was reduced in the kidney tissues of DN patients and mice, serum of DN patients, and HG-HK-2 cells. Moreover, the inhibition of ALR promoted ferroptosis, macrophage activation, and DN progression. Mechanistically, ALR can directly bind to carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1A (CPT1A), the key rate-limiting enzyme of fatty acid oxidation (FAO), and inhibit the expression of CPT1A to regulate lipid metabolism involving FAO and lipid droplet-mitochondrial coupling in DN. Taken together, our findings revealed a crucial protective role of ALR in ferroptosis induction and macrophage activation in DN and identified it as an alternative diagnostic marker and therapeutic target for DN.",2,diagnosis
38767382,Building Trustworthy Generative Artificial Intelligence for Diabetes Care and Limb Preservation: A Medical Knowledge Extraction Case.,"Large language models (LLMs) offer significant potential in medical information extraction but carry risks of generating incorrect information. This study aims to develop and validate a retriever-augmented generation (RAG) model that provides accurate medical knowledge about diabetes and diabetic foot care to laypersons with an eighth-grade literacy level. Improving health literacy through patient education is paramount to addressing the problem of limb loss in the diabetic population. In addition to affecting patient well-being through improved outcomes, improved physician well-being is an important outcome of a self-management model for patient health education. We used an RAG architecture and built a question-and-answer artificial intelligence (AI) model to extract knowledge in response to questions pertaining to diabetes and diabetic foot care. We utilized GPT-4 by OpenAI, with Pinecone as a vector database. The NIH National Standards for Diabetes Self-Management Education served as the basis for our knowledge base. The model's outputs were validated through expert review against established guidelines and literature. Fifty-eight keywords were used to select 295 articles and the model was tested against 175 questions across topics. The study demonstrated that with appropriate content volume and few-shot learning prompts, the RAG model achieved 98% accuracy, confirming its capability to offer user-friendly and comprehensible medical information. The RAG model represents a promising tool for delivering reliable medical knowledge to the public which can be used for self-education and self-management for diabetes, highlighting the importance of content validation and innovative prompt engineering in AI applications.",2,diagnosis
38767365,Isolation of Nuclei from Human Intermuscular Adipose Tissue and Downstream Single-Nuclei RNA Sequencing.,"Intermuscular adipose tissue (IMAT) is a relatively understudied adipose depot located between muscle fibers. IMAT content increases with age and BMI and is associated with metabolic and muscle degenerative diseases; however, an understanding of the biological properties of IMAT and its interplay with the surrounding muscle fibers is severely lacking. In recent years, single-cell and nuclei RNA sequencing have provided us with cell type-specific atlases of several human tissues. However, the cellular composition of human IMAT remains largely unexplored due to the inherent challenges of its accessibility from biopsy collection in humans. In addition to the limited amount of tissue collected, the processing of human IMAT is complicated due to its proximity to skeletal muscle tissue and fascia. The lipid-laden nature of the adipocytes makes it incompatible with single-cell isolation. Hence, single nuclei RNA sequencing is optimal for obtaining high-dimensional transcriptomics at single-cell resolution and provides the potential to uncover the biology of this depot, including the exact cellular composition of IMAT. Here, we present a detailed protocol for nuclei isolation and library preparation of frozen human IMAT for single nuclei RNA sequencing. This protocol allows for the profiling of thousands of nuclei using a droplet-based approach, thus providing the capacity to detect rare and low-abundant cell types.",2,diagnosis
38767350,Changes in the type 2 diabetes gut mycobiome associate with metformin treatment across populations.,"The human gut teems with a diverse ecosystem of microbes, yet non-bacterial portions of that community are overlooked in studies of metabolic diseases firmly linked to gut bacteria. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) is associated with compositional shifts in the gut bacterial microbiome and the mycobiome, the fungal portion of the microbiome. However, whether T2D and/or metformin treatment underpins fungal community changes is unresolved. To differentiate these effects, we curated a gut mycobiome cohort spanning 1,000 human samples across five countries and validated our findings in a murine experimental model. We use Bayesian multinomial logistic normal models to show that T2D and metformin both associate with shifts in the relative abundance of distinct gut fungi. T2D is associated with shifts in the Saccharomycetes and Sordariomycetes fungal classes, while the genera <i>Fusarium</i> and <i>Tetrapisipora</i> most consistently associate with metformin treatment. We confirmed the impact of metformin on individual gut fungi by administering metformin to healthy mice. Thus, metformin and T2D account for subtle, but significant and distinct variation in the gut mycobiome across human populations. This work highlights for the first time that metformin can confound associations of gut fungi with T2D and warrants the need to consider pharmaceutical interventions in investigations of linkages between metabolic diseases and gut microbial inhabitants. This is the largest to-date multi-country cohort characterizing the human gut mycobiome, and the first to investigate potential perturbations in gut fungi from oral pharmaceutical treatment. We demonstrate the reproducible effects of metformin treatment on the human and murine gut mycobiome and highlight a need to consider metformin as a confounding factor in investigations between type 2 diabetes mellitus and the gut microbial ecosystem.",2,diagnosis
38767331,Decoding the complexity of delayed wound healing following <i>Enterococcus faecalis</i> infection.,"Wound infections are highly prevalent and can lead to delayed or failed healing, causing significant morbidity and adverse economic impacts. These infections occur in various contexts, including diabetic foot ulcers, burns, and surgical sites. <i>Enterococcus faecalis</i> is often found in persistent non-healing wounds, but its contribution to chronic wounds remains understudied. To address this, we employed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on infected wounds in comparison to uninfected wounds in a mouse model. Examining over 23,000 cells, we created a comprehensive single-cell atlas that captures the cellular and transcriptomic landscape of these wounds. Our analysis revealed unique transcriptional and metabolic alterations in infected wounds, elucidating the distinct molecular changes associated with bacterial infection compared to the normal wound healing process. We identified dysregulated keratinocyte and fibroblast transcriptomes in response to infection, jointly contributing to an anti-inflammatory environment. Notably, <i>E. faecalis</i> infection prompted a premature, incomplete epithelial-mesenchymal transition in keratinocytes. Additionally, <i>E. faecalis</i> infection modulated M2-like macrophage polarization by inhibiting pro-inflammatory resolution in vitro, in vivo, and in our scRNA-seq atlas. Furthermore, we discovered macrophage crosstalk with neutrophils, which regulates chemokine signaling pathways, while promoting anti-inflammatory interactions with endothelial cells. Overall, our findings offer new insights into the immunosuppressive role of <i>E. faecalis</i> in wound infections.",2,diagnosis
38767251,Influence of mHealth-Based Lifestyle Interventions on Symptoms of Anxiety and Depression of Women With Gestational Diabetes: A Meta-Analysis.,"Symptoms of anxiety and depression are common in women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Mobile health (mHealth)-based lifestyle interventions have been shown to be effective in improving glycemic control of these women. The aim of the study was to evaluate the influence of mHealth-based lifestyle interventions on symptoms of anxiety and depression in women with GDM. A systematic review and meta-analysis or randomized controlled trials. Clinical or community-based settings. Nine studies involving 1,168 pregnant women with GDM were included. mHealth-based lifestyle interventions. Symptoms of anxiety and depression quantitatively analyzed in clinical scales. A systematic literature search was performed in electronic databases, including PubMed, Cochrane library, Embase, Web of Science, Wanfang, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure to obtain relevant randomized controlled studies. A random-effects model was used to pool the results by incorporating the impact of the potential heterogeneity. Findings revealed that when compared to usual care, women who received mHealth-based lifestyle interventions had significant improvements in symptoms of anxiety (standardized mean difference [SMD]: -0.55, 95% CI [-0.77, -0.33], <i>p</i> < .001; <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 67%) and depression (SMD: -0.51, [-0.72, -0.29], <i>p</i> < .001; <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 65%). Sensitivity analyses by excluding one study at a time showed consistent results. Subgroup analyses showed similar results in mHealth achieved by phone, websites, and applications, in mHealth targeting diet and exercise with and without psychological support, in mHealth lead by nurse with and without other clinical specialists, and in studies with different evaluating tools for anxiety and depression. mHealth-based lifestyle interventions could significantly improve the symptoms of anxiety and depression in women with GDM.",2,diagnosis
38767210,T cells in obesity-associated inflammation: The devil is in the details.,"Obesity presents a significant health challenge, affecting 41% of adults and 19.7% of children in the United States. One of the associated health challenges of obesity is chronic low-grade inflammation. In both mice and humans, T cells in circulation and in the adipose tissue play a pivotal role in obesity-associated inflammation. Changes in the numbers and frequency of specific CD4<sup>+</sup> Th subsets and their contribution to inflammation through cytokine production indicate declining metabolic health, that is, insulin resistance and T2D. While some Th subset alterations are consistent between mice and humans with obesity, some changes mainly characterize male mice, whereas female mice often resist obesity and inflammation. However, protection from obesity and inflammation is not observed in human females, who can develop obesity-related T-cell inflammation akin to males. The decline in female sex hormones after menopause is also implicated in promoting obesity and inflammation. Age is a second underappreciated factor for defining and regulating obesity-associated inflammation toward translating basic science findings to the clinic. Weight loss in mice and humans, in parallel with these other factors, does not resolve obesity-associated inflammation. Instead, inflammation persists amid modest changes in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell frequencies, highlighting the need for further research into resolving changes in T-cell function after weight loss. How lingering inflammation after weight loss affecting the common struggle to maintain lower weight is unknown. Semaglutide, a newly popular pharmaceutical used for treating T2D and reversing obesity, holds promise for alleviating obesity-associated health complications, yet its impact on T-cell-mediated inflammation remains unexplored. Further work in this area could significantly contribute to the scientific understanding of the impacts of weight loss and sex/hormones in obesity and obesity-associated metabolic decline.",2,diagnosis
38767133,Lipoprotein (a) concentration as a risk factor for ischaemic stroke and its subtypes.,"To investigate the relationship between serum lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)] concentration and the risk of ischaemic stroke (IS) and its subtypes. Lp(a) plays a role in atherogenic, pro-thrombotic, and antifibrinolytic processes. Elevated plasma Lp(a) is a strong independent risk factor for the development and progression of atherosclerotic disease. The association between lipoproteins and IS is more complex than that reported for cardiovascular diseases, with inconsistent and contradictory results from epidemiological studies. 231 patients with acute IS (defined as cases) and 163 age- and sex-matched control subjects were included in this prospective case-control study. Demographic and clinical variables (i.e. age, sex, smoking, presence of chronic diseases and concomitant medication) and laboratory data (i.e. concentrations of total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, triglycerides, Lp(a), apolipoprotein A1, apolipoprotein B) were recorded. The mean age and the percentage of men did not significantly differ between groups. Compared to controls, there was a significantly higher percentage of cases reported with concomitant diseases: diabetes mellitus, myocardial infarction, ischaemic heart disease, peripheral arterial disease, and atrial fibrillation. The study showed a significantly higher serum Lp(a) concentration in cases than in control subjects (81.81 nmol/L [c.32.7 mg/dL] vs. 59.75 nmol/L [c.23.9 mg/dL]; p = 0.036) and found an association between Lp(a) levels stratified by quartiles and the risk for ischaemic stroke (Q1 [Lp(a) < 13 nmol/L] vs. Q4 [Lp(a) > 117 nmol/L]: OR 2.23; 95% CI 1.23-4.03; p = 0.008). A subgroup analysis based on the TOAST classification of IS also showed a significant association between Lp(a) value of more than 75 nmol/L (30 mg/dL) and the risk of large-artery atherosclerosis stroke compared to the controls (OR 2.4; 95% CI 1.39-3.93; p = 0.001), as well as a statistically non-significant association with other subtypes of IS. The influence of Lp(a) remained significant even after adjusting for established risk factors for IS (OR 1.99; 95% CI 1.05-3.76; p = 0.04; respectively for the large-artery atherosclerotic subtype: OR 2.54; 95% CI 1.39-4.67; p = 0.003). We found that Lp(a) is an independent risk factor for ischaemic stroke, and for the large-artery atherosclerotic subtype of ischaemic stroke.",2,treatment
38767130,Immediate response to intravitreal treatment for macular edema due to diabetes and retinal vein occlusion.,"To objectively assess the immediate response to intravitreal treatment for macular edema and compare it across different agents. This retrospective, comparative study included patients with macular edema due to diabetic retinopathy (DME) or vein occlusion who were treated with intravitreal injections of either steroids (triamcinolone acetonide or dexamethasone sustained release implant) or anti-vascular endothelial growth factor antibodies (VEGF). The central retinal thickness (CRT) and the best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) were measured 1 day after the injection and compared with immediate pre-injection values. There were 79 eyes (57 patients) including 51 eyes with DME, 18 with branch retinal vein occlusion edema (BRVO-ME), and 10 eyes with central retinal vein occlusion edema (CRVO-ME). The intravitreal agents were triamcinolone acetonide (TA)(<i>n</i> = 15), dexamethasone sustained release implant (DEX)(<i>n</i> = 22), ranibizumab (<i>n</i> = 19), and bevacizumab (<i>n</i> = 23). Statistically significant improvement in CRT was seen in all injection groups (<i>p</i> < 0.05) while improvement in mean BCVA was significant only in the TA group (<i>p</i> = 0.009). The mean change in CRT was maximum with steroids than with anti-VEGFs; viz. 159.47 µ in TA, 115.45 µ in DEX, 86.10 µ in ranibizumab, and 78.78 µ in bevacizumab group. Least amount of change was noted in the spongy type of macular edema (18.73 µ) while improvement in mean BCVA was statistically significant only in the cystoid group (<i>p</i> = 0.01). Comparatively, steroid agents showed better immediate response to therapy than anti-VEGFs. Maximum reduction in central retinal thickness was seen following triamcinolone acetonide injection. Cystoid edema showed better immediate response than spongy retinal thickening.",2,diagnosis
38767128,Severe dawn phenomenon predicts long-term risk of all-cause mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes.,"The dawn phenomenon (DP) is an abnormal early morning blood glucose rise without nocturnal hypoglycaemia, which can be more easily and precisely assessed with continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). This prospective study aimed to explore the association between DP and the risk of all-cause mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes. A total of 5542 adult inpatients with type 2 diabetes in a single centre were analysed. The magnitude of DP (ΔG) was defined as the increment in the CGM-determined glucose value from nocturnal nadir (after 24:00) to prebreakfast. Participants were stratified into four groups by ΔG: ≤1.11, 1.12-3.33, 3.34-5.55, and >5.55 mmol/L. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to evaluate the impact of DP on all-cause mortality risk. During a median follow-up of 9.4 years, 1083 deaths were identified. The restricted cubic spline revealed a nonlinear (p for nonlinearity = 0.002) relationship between ΔG and the risk of all-cause mortality. A multivariate-adjusted Cox regression model including glycated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) showed that ΔG > 5.55 mmol/L was associated with 30% (95% CI, 1.01-1.66) higher risk of all-cause mortality, as compared with ΔG 1.12-3.33 mmol/L. Higher ΔG is significantly related to an increased risk of all-cause mortality in type 2 diabetes, suggesting that severe DP should be given more attention as a part of glucose management to reduce the risk of long-term adverse outcomes.",2,diagnosis

We conducted a retrospective analysis of 713 autoantibody-positive participants who developed type 1 diabetes in the TrialNet Pathway to Prevention Study who had T1DExomeChip data. We evaluated the relationships of 16 known SNPs and T1D-GRS2 with area under the curve (AUC) C-peptide levels during oral glucose tolerance tests conducted in the 9 months before diagnosis. Higher T1D-GRS2 was associated with lower C-peptide AUC in the 9 months before diagnosis in univariate (β=-0.06, P<0.0001) and multivariate (β=-0.03, P=0.005) analyses. Participants with the JAZF1 rs864745 T allele had lower C-peptide AUC in both univariate (β=-0.11, P=0.002) and multivariate (β=-0.06, P=0.018) analyses. The type 2 diabetes-associated JAZF1 rs864745 T allele and higher T1D-GRS2 are associated with lower C-peptide AUC prior to diagnosis of type 1 diabetes, with implications for the design of prevention trials.",0,prevention
38767114,Androgens Modulate the Immune Profile in a Mouse Model of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome.,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is associated with a low-grade inflammation, but it is unknown how hyperandrogenism, the hallmark of PCOS, affects the immune system. Using a PCOS-like mouse model, it is demonstrated that hyperandrogenism affects immune cell populations in reproductive, metabolic, and immunological tissues differently in a site-specific manner. Co-treatment with an androgen receptor antagonist prevents most of these alterations, demonstrating that these effects are mediated through androgen receptor activation. Dihydrotestosterone (DHT)-exposed mice displayed a drastically reduced eosinophil population in the uterus and visceral adipose tissue (VAT). A higher frequency of natural killer (NK) cells and elevated levels of IFN-γ and TNF-α are seen in uteri of androgen-exposed mice, while NK cells in VAT and spleen displayed a higher expression level of CD69, a marker of activation or tissue residency. Distinct alterations of macrophages in the uterus, ovaries, and VAT are also found in DHT-exposed mice and can potentially be linked to PCOS-like traits of the model. Indeed, androgen-exposed mice are insulin-resistant, albeit unaltered fat mass. Collectively, it is demonstrated that hyperandrogenism causes tissue-specific alterations of immune cells in reproductive organs and VAT, which can have considerable implications on tissue function and contribute to the reduced fertility and metabolic comorbidities associated with PCOS.",2,diagnosis

Its effectiveness and tolerability as an addition to metformin, DPP4 inhibitor and insulin treatment in type 2 diabetic patients will be examined in this research. Participants with type 2 diabetes from poor socio-economic backgrounds had HbA1c values ≥8.5% when using Insulin+Metformin+DPP-4 inhibitors. They received 10mg Empagliflozin daily for 12 weeks (n=143). The main outcome was change in HbA1c at 12<sup>th</sup> week from baseline. Secondary outcomes were baseline weight and week 12 FPG. Adjusted mean (SE) HbA1c increases at week 12 were: Mean ± SD 10.38 (6.8-17.0) vs. Mean±SD 9.05±1.77 (5.60-16.0) with empagliflozin 10mg. When added to the regimen, empagliflozin significantly reduced FPG, systolic and diastolic blood pressure.

38769364,A dynamic probabilistic model of the onset and interaction of cardio-metabolic comorbidities on an ageing adult population.,"Comorbidity is widespread in the ageing population, implying multiple and complex medical needs for individuals and a public health burden. Determining risk factors and predicting comorbidity development can help identify at-risk subjects and design prevention strategies. Using socio-demographic and clinical data from approximately 11,000 subjects monitored over 11 years in the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, we develop a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) to model the onset and interaction of three cardio-metabolic comorbidities, namely type 2 diabetes (T2D), hypertension, and heart problems. The DBN allows us to identify risk factors for developing each morbidity, simulate ageing progression over time, and stratify the population based on the risk of outcome occurrence. By applying hierarchical agglomerative clustering to the simulated, dynamic risk of experiencing morbidities, we identified patients with similar risk patterns and the variables contributing to their discrimination. The network reveals a direct joint effect of biomarkers and lifestyle on outcomes over time, such as the impact of fasting glucose, HbA1c, and BMI on T2D development. Mediated cross-relationships between comorbidities also emerge, showcasing the interconnected nature of these health issues. The model presents good calibration and discrimination ability, particularly in predicting the onset of T2D (iAUC-ROC = 0.828, iAUC-PR = 0.294) and survival (iAUC-ROC = 0.827, iAUC-PR = 0.311). Stratification analysis unveils two distinct clusters for all comorbidities, effectively discriminated by variables like HbA1c for T2D and age at baseline for heart problems. The developed DBN constitutes an effective, highly-explainable predictive risk tool for simulating and stratifying the dynamic risk of developing cardio-metabolic comorbidities. Its use could help identify the effects of risk factors and develop health policies that prevent the occurrence of comorbidities.",0,prevention

Study associations between food insecurity and severe hypoglycemia. Survey based cross-sectional study. Survey responses were collected in 2019 from 1,164 older (≥ 65 years) patients with type 2 diabetes treated with insulin or sulfonylureas. Risk ratios (RR) for economic and physical food insecurity associated with self-reported severe hypoglycemia (low blood glucose requiring assistance) adjusted for age, financial strain, HbA1c, Charlson comorbidity score and frailty. Self-reported reasons for hypoglycemia endorsed by respondents. Food insecurity was reported by 12.3% of the respondents; of whom 38.4% reported economic food insecurity only, 21.1% physical food insecurity only and 40.5% both. Economic food insecurity and physical food insecurity were strongly associated with severe hypoglycemia (RR = 4.3; p = 0.02 and RR = 4.4; p = 0.002, respectively). Missed meals (""skipped meals, not eating enough or waiting too long to eat"") was the dominant reason (77.5%) given for hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia prevention efforts among older patients with diabetes using hypoglycemia-prone medications should address food insecurity.

The network reveals a direct joint effect of biomarkers and lifestyle on outcomes over time, such as the impact of fasting glucose, HbA1c, and BMI on T2D development. Mediated cross-relationships between comorbidities also emerge, showcasing the interconnected nature of these health issues. The model presents good calibration and discrimination ability, particularly in predicting the onset of T2D (iAUC-ROC = 0.828, iAUC-PR = 0.294) and survival (iAUC-ROC = 0.827, iAUC-PR = 0.311). Stratification analysis unveils two distinct clusters for all comorbidities, effectively discriminated by variables like HbA1c for T2D and age at baseline for heart problems. The developed DBN constitutes an effective, highly-explainable predictive risk tool for simulating and stratifying the dynamic risk of developing cardio-metabolic comorbidities. Its use could help identify the effects of risk factors and develop health policies that prevent the occurrence of comorbidities.",0,prevention
38769011,Evaluation of systemic medications associated with diabetic retinopathy: a nested case-control study from the UK Biobank.,"This study aims to investigate the associations between commonly used systemic medications and diabetic retinopathy (DR). Individuals with linked primary care prescription data from the UK Biobank were included. Cases were defined as individuals with a Hospital Episode Statistics-coded or primary care recorded diagnosis of DR or self-reported DR. Controls were matched for age, sex, glycosylated haemoglobin, duration of diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension status and cardiovascular disease status. ORs and 95% CIs were calculated using conditional univariate and multivariable logistic regression models. A total of 3377 case subjects with DR were included in the study and matched with 3377 control subjects. In multivariable logistic regression, increased odds of incident DR were observed for exposure to short-acting insulins (OR 1.63; 95% CI 1.22 to 2.18), medium-acting insulins (OR 2.10; 95% CI 1.60 to 2.75), sulfonylureas (OR 1.30; 95% CI 1.16 to 1.46). Instead, the use of fibrates (OR 0.71; 95% CI 0.53 to 0.94) and Cox-2 inhibitors (OR 0.68; 95% CI 0.58 to 0.79) was associated with decreased odds of incident DR. Dose-response relationships were observed for all five drug categories (all p<0.05). This study comprehensively investigated the associations between systemic medication use and DR and found significant associations between the use of short-acting insulins, medium-acting insulins and sulfonylureas with increased odds of incident DR. In contrast, fibrates and Cox-2 inhibitors were associated with decreased odds of incident DR. These findings may provide valuable insights into DM medication management and serve as a reference for the prevention of DR in patients with DM.",0,prevention
38767674,Assessment of genetic and clinical factors in T2D susceptibility among patients with hypertension.,"Hypertension (HTN) and Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) often coexist, therefore understanding the relationship between both diseases is imperative to guide targeted prevention/therapy. This study aims to explore the relationship between HTN and T2D using genome-wide association study (GWAS) analysis and biochemical data to understand the implication of both clinical and genetic factors in these pathologies. A total of 2,876 patients were enrolled. Using GWAS and biochemical data, patients with both T2D and HTN were compared to patients with only HTN. Specificity was confirmed by testing the detected genetic variants for associations with HTN development in T2D patients, or with HTN in healthy subjects. Regression models were applied to examine the association of T2D in patients with HTN with cardiovascular risk factors. Replication was performed using UK Biobank dataset with 31,170 subjects. Data showed that females with HTN are at higher risk of developing T2D due to dyslipidemia, while males faced higher risk due to high BMI (body mass index) and family history of T2D. GWAS identified Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) linked to T2D in patients with HTN. Notably, rs7865889, rs7756992, and rs10896290 were positively associated with T2D, whereas rs12737517 yielded negative association. Three SNPs were replicated in the UK Biobank (rs10896290, rs7865889, and rs7756992). Incorporating clinical and genetic screening into risk assessment is important for the detection and prevention of T2D in patients with HTN. The detected SNPs (rs7865889, rs12737517, and rs10896290), especially the protective SNP (rs12737517), provide an opportunity for better diagnosis, prevention, and therapy of patients with T2D and HTN.",0,prevention

38769291,First report of anthracnose of <i>Lithocarpus polystachyus</i> caused by <i>Colletotrichum fructicola</i> in China.,"Lithocarpus polystachyus (Wall. ex A. DC.), an economically valuable plant species belonging to the Fagaceae family, has been used as herbal tea to prevent diabetes because of the high content of flavonoids and dihydrochalcones in the leaves (Shang et al. 2022). In July 2022, the severe leaf lesion on L. polystachyus was first observed in Yongshun County, Xiangxi autonomous prefecture (28°45'34''N, 109°40'11''E), Hunan province, China. Yongshun County is characterized by hills and mountains, situated in a subtropical region with a mild and humid climate. A second outbreak in July 2023 was observed in the same area. The observed incident rates in the past two years were 87.3% and 90.6%, respectively. Once infected, almost all plant leaves will be infected, leading to a substantial reduction in the yield of L. polystachyus. The disease presented symptoms characterized by round or irregularly shaped lesions that initially manifested as brown spots. These lesions frequently merged into larger, dark-brown areas along the leaf margins before eventually wilting. To ascertain the pathogenic species responsible for this disease, fungal isolation was conducted using a tissue separation method (Xu et al. 2023). The infected leaf tissues were surface-disinfected with 75% ethanol and 0.1% HgCl then small pieces (1×1 cm), were placed onto potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium (Sigma-Aldrich, 70139) and incubated at 28°C for 6-9 days. Colonies were villiform and initially white, becoming gray after 6 days. Sterilized dissecting needles were used to pick single hyphal tips from the edge of the colonies and placed onto PDA for strain purification. After 15 days, the purified colonies grew fluffy white hyphae with abundant conidia. The conidia were cylindrical, had round ends, and ranged from 5.75 to 14.83 μm long and 1.75 to 2.38 μm wide (n=50). According to morphological and cultural characteristics, these isolates were preliminarily identified as Colletotrichum fructicola Prihast., L. Cai & K.D. Hyde (Damm et al. 2012). To further affirm the identity of the pathogen, DNA was extracted from mycelia using a DNA extraction kit (Sigma-Aldrich, G2N70). The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, the transcription elongation factor (TEF), and the actin (ACT) gene were then amplified from genomic DNA extracted from three isolates (Cof1, Cof2, and Cof3) using specific primers. The primers utilized were ITS1/ITS4 (White et al. 1990), EF1-728F/EF1-986R and ACT-512F/ACT-783R (Carbone and Kohn 1999) for ITS region, transcription elongation factor gene and actin gene amplification, respectively. Sequence identity indicated that these isolates were highly homologous to C. fructicola. The ITS (Genbank No. PP002156, OR880553 and OR880554), TEF (No. PP061421, PP061422 and PP061423), and ACT (No. PP061418, PP061419 and PP061420) sequences of the isolates Cof1, Cof2, and Cof3 shared 99 to 100% identity with their counterparts (No. OR083309, MF627961, and OQ427895) in C. fructicola, respectively. A neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree constructed using MEGA11 (Tamura et al. 2021) also indicated that these isolates were C. fructicola. Both morphological and molecular characteristics confirmed the identification of this pathogen as C. fructicola. Colletotrichum species are known to cause anthracnose disease in a variety of economically important crops (Sharma and Kulshrestha 2015). To further validate the ability of the isolated C. fructicola to induce the same symptoms as observed in the field, the pathogenicity assay was assessed following Koch's postulates (Gradmann, 2014). Conidial suspensions (1×105 conidia per mL) from three isolates were individually inoculated onto artificially wounded leaves of 3-year-old L. polystachyus. Negative controls were established by inoculating leaf wounds with sterile distilled water. The plants were incubated in a greenhouse at 28°C and 90% humidity with a 12-h photoperiod. The experiment was replicated three times. Necrotic lesions were observed on all pathogen-inoculated wounds within 6 days after inoculation, whereas controls showed no observable symptoms. Morphological and molecular characterization of re-isolated pathogens from infected leaves indicated that the pathogens were identical. To our knowledge, this is the first report of anthracnose of L. polystachyus caused by C. fructicola in China. Farmers in the local mountainous areas are economically reliant on L. polystachyus production, while anthracnose has caused over half of the trees to lose their commercial value, resulting in significant economic losses. Our findings hold great promise for advancing strategies in the prevention and treatment of anthracnose in L. polystachyus.",0,prevention
38767746,Food Insecurity and Hypoglycemia among Older Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Treated with Insulin or Sulfonylureas: The Diabetes & Aging Study.,"Severe hypoglycemia is a serious adverse drug event associated with hypoglycemia-prone medications; older patients with diabetes are particularly at high risk. Economic food insecurity (food insecurity due to financial limitations) is a known risk factor for hypoglycemia; however, less is known about physical food insecurity (due to difficulty cooking or shopping for food), which may increase with age, and its association with hypoglycemia. Study associations between food insecurity and severe hypoglycemia. Survey based cross-sectional study. Survey responses were collected in 2019 from 1,164 older (≥ 65 years) patients with type 2 diabetes treated with insulin or sulfonylureas. Risk ratios (RR) for economic and physical food insecurity associated with self-reported severe hypoglycemia (low blood glucose requiring assistance) adjusted for age, financial strain, HbA1c, Charlson comorbidity score and frailty. Self-reported reasons for hypoglycemia endorsed by respondents. Food insecurity was reported by 12.3% of the respondents; of whom 38.4% reported economic food insecurity only, 21.1% physical food insecurity only and 40.5% both. Economic food insecurity and physical food insecurity were strongly associated with severe hypoglycemia (RR = 4.3; p = 0.02 and RR = 4.4; p = 0.002, respectively). Missed meals (""skipped meals, not eating enough or waiting too long to eat"") was the dominant reason (77.5%) given for hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia prevention efforts among older patients with diabetes using hypoglycemia-prone medications should address food insecurity. Standard food insecurity questions, which are used to identify economic food insecurity, will fail to identify patients who have physical food insecurity only.",0,prevention
38767115,Genetic Associations with C-peptide Levels before Type 1 Diabetes Diagnosis in At-Risk Relatives.,"We sought to determine whether the type 1 diabetes genetic risk score-2 (T1D-GRS2) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are associated with C-peptide preservation before type 1 diabetes diagnosis. We conducted a retrospective analysis of 713 autoantibody-positive participants who developed type 1 diabetes in the TrialNet Pathway to Prevention Study who had T1DExomeChip data. We evaluated the relationships of 16 known SNPs and T1D-GRS2 with area under the curve (AUC) C-peptide levels during oral glucose tolerance tests conducted in the 9 months before diagnosis. Higher T1D-GRS2 was associated with lower C-peptide AUC in the 9 months before diagnosis in univariate (β=-0.06, P<0.0001) and multivariate (β=-0.03, P=0.005) analyses. Participants with the JAZF1 rs864745 T allele had lower C-peptide AUC in both univariate (β=-0.11, P=0.002) and multivariate (β=-0.06, P=0.018) analyses.

The infected leaf tissues were surface-disinfected with 75% ethanol and 0.1% HgCl then small pieces (1×1 cm), were placed onto potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium (Sigma-Aldrich, 70139) and incubated at 28°C for 6-9 days. Colonies were villiform and initially white, becoming gray after 6 days. Sterilized dissecting needles were used to pick single hyphal tips from the edge of the colonies and placed onto PDA for strain purification. After 15 days, the purified colonies grew fluffy white hyphae with abundant conidia. The conidia were cylindrical, had round ends, and ranged from 5.75 to 14.83 μm long and 1.75 to 2.38 μm wide (n=50). According to morphological and cultural characteristics, these isolates were preliminarily identified as Colletotrichum fructicola Prihast., L. Cai & K.D. Hyde (Damm et al. 2012). To further affirm the identity of the pathogen, DNA was extracted from mycelia using a DNA extraction kit (Sigma-Aldrich, G2N70). The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, the transcription elongation factor (TEF), and the actin (ACT) gene were then amplified from genomic DNA extracted from three isolates (Cof1, Cof2, and Cof3) using specific primers. The primers utilized were ITS1/ITS4 (White et al. 1990), EF1-728F/EF1-986R and ACT-512F/ACT-783R (Carbone and Kohn 1999) for ITS region, transcription elongation factor gene and actin gene amplification, respectively. Sequence identity indicated that these isolates were highly homologous to C. fructicola. The ITS (Genbank No. PP002156, OR880553 and OR880554), TEF (No. PP061421, PP061422 and PP061423), and ACT (No. PP061418, PP061419 and PP061420) sequences of the isolates Cof1, Cof2, and Cof3 shared 99 to 100% identity with their counterparts (No. OR083309, MF627961, and OQ427895) in C. fructicola, respectively. A neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree constructed using MEGA11 (Tamura et al. 2021) also indicated that these isolates were C. fructicola. Both morphological and molecular characteristics confirmed the identification of this pathogen as C. fructicola. Colletotrichum species are known to cause anthracnose disease in a variety of economically important crops (Sharma and Kulshrestha 2015). To further validate the ability of the isolated C. fructicola to induce the same symptoms as observed in the field, the pathogenicity assay was assessed following Koch's postulates (Gradmann, 2014). Conidial suspensions (1×105 conidia per mL) from three isolates were individually inoculated onto artificially wounded leaves of 3-year-old L. polystachyus. Negative controls were established by inoculating leaf wounds with sterile distilled water. The plants were incubated in a greenhouse at 28°C and 90% humidity with a 12-h photoperiod. The experiment was replicated three times. Necrotic lesions were observed on all pathogen-inoculated wounds within 6 days after inoculation, whereas controls showed no observable symptoms. Morphological and molecular characterization of re-isolated pathogens from infected leaves indicated that the pathogens were identical. To our knowledge, this is the first report of anthracnose of L. polystachyus caused by C. fructicola in China. Farmers in the local mountainous areas are economically reliant on L. polystachyus production, while anthracnose has caused over half of the trees to lose their commercial value, resulting in significant economic losses. Our findings hold great promise for advancing strategies in the prevention and treatment of anthracnose in L. polystachyus.",0,prevention
38767115,Genetic Associations with C-peptide Levels before Type 1 Diabetes Diagnosis in At-Risk Relatives.,"We sought to determine whether the type 1 diabetes genetic risk score-2 (T1D-GRS2) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are associated with C-peptide preservation before type 1 diabetes diagnosis. We conducted a retrospective analysis of 713 autoantibody-positive participants who developed type 1 diabetes in the TrialNet Pathway to Prevention Study who had T1DExomeChip data. We evaluated the relationships of 16 known SNPs and T1D-GRS2 with area under the curve (AUC) C-peptide levels during oral glucose tolerance tests conducted in the 9 months before diagnosis. Higher T1D-GRS2 was associated with lower C-peptide AUC in the 9 months before diagnosis in univariate (β=-0.06, P<0.0001) and multivariate (β=-0.03, P=0.005) analyses. Participants with the JAZF1 rs864745 T allele had lower C-peptide AUC in both univariate (β=-0.11, P=0.002) and multivariate (β=-0.06, P=0.018) analyses. The type 2 diabetes-associated JAZF1 rs864745 T allele and higher T1D-GRS2 are associated with lower C-peptide AUC prior to diagnosis of type 1 diabetes, with implications for the design of prevention trials.",0,prevention
38767740,Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease and Ethnicity: Lessons Learned from the Arab Population in Israel.,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common liver disease. We aimed to investigate the potential similarities and differences regarding the disease among Arabs and Jews. Retrospective study included all patients older than 18 years with NAFLD diagnosis according to ICD-10 codes. Data regarding demographics, comorbidities, and outcomes were retrieved using the MdClone platform from ""Clalit"" in Israel. Data concerning 34,090 Arab patients and 173,500 Jewish patients with NAFLD were included. Arab patients were significantly younger at diagnosis (35.0 ± 13 years vs. 43.6 ± 15 years, p < 0.001) and had higher rates of obesity and diabetes mellitus (69.5% vs. 56.5% and 27.0% vs. 22.7%, p < 0.001, respectively). Arab patients had higher rates of cirrhosis and portal hypertension-related complications (2.5% vs. 2.0%, p < 0.001), esophageal varices (0.9% vs. 0.5%, p < 0.001), spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (0.3% vs. 0.1%, p < 0.001), and hepatorenal syndrome (0.3% vs. 0.1%, p < 0.001). There was no significant difference in the prevalence of hepatocellular carcinoma between study groups (0.4% vs. 0.5%, p = 0.156). Liver transplantation was performed in 0.2% of Arab NAFLD patients compared to 0.07% of Jewish NAFLD patients (p < 0.001). Lower rates of all-cause mortality were found among the Arab NAFLD patients versus Jewish NAFLD patients (7.7% versus 11.5%, p < 0.001). According to the Cox regression model, Arab ethnicity is a risk factor for death with OR of 1.36. Significant differences regarding comorbidities, complications, liver transplantations rates, and all-cause mortality were found among NAFLD patients of different ethnicities, hence specific population need specific consideration in prevention, early diagnosis and follow up.",0,prevention
38767674,Assessment of genetic and clinical factors in T2D susceptibility among patients with hypertension.,"Hypertension (HTN) and Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) often coexist, therefore understanding the relationship between both diseases is imperative to guide targeted prevention/therapy. This study aims to explore the relationship between HTN and T2D using genome-wide association study (GWAS) analysis and biochemical data to understand the implication of both clinical and genetic factors in these pathologies. A total of 2,876 patients were enrolled. Using GWAS and biochemical data, patients with both T2D and HTN were compared to patients with only HTN. Specificity was confirmed by testing the detected genetic variants for associations with HTN development in T2D patients, or with HTN in healthy subjects. Regression models were applied to examine the association of T2D in patients with HTN with cardiovascular risk factors. Replication was performed using UK Biobank dataset with 31,170 subjects. Data showed that females with HTN are at higher risk of developing T2D due to dyslipidemia, while males faced higher risk due to high BMI (body mass index) and family history of T2D. GWAS identified Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) linked to T2D in patients with HTN. Notably, rs7865889, rs7756992, and rs10896290 were positively associated with T2D, whereas rs12737517 yielded negative association. Three SNPs were replicated in the UK Biobank (rs10896290, rs7865889, and rs7756992). Incorporating clinical and genetic screening into risk assessment is important for the detection and prevention of T2D in patients with HTN. The detected SNPs (rs7865889, rs12737517, and rs10896290), especially the protective SNP (rs12737517), provide an opportunity for better diagnosis, prevention, and therapy of patients with T2D and HTN.",0,prevention

In July 2022, the severe leaf lesion on L. polystachyus was first observed in Yongshun County, Xiangxi autonomous prefecture (28°45'34''N, 109°40'11''E), Hunan province, China. Yongshun County is characterized by hills and mountains, situated in a subtropical region with a mild and humid climate. A second outbreak in July 2023 was observed in the same area. The observed incident rates in the past two years were 87.3% and 90.6%, respectively. Once infected, almost all plant leaves will be infected, leading to a substantial reduction in the yield of L. polystachyus. The disease presented symptoms characterized by round or irregularly shaped lesions that initially manifested as brown spots. These lesions frequently merged into larger, dark-brown areas along the leaf margins before eventually wilting. To ascertain the pathogenic species responsible for this disease, fungal isolation was conducted using a tissue separation method (Xu et al. 2023). The infected leaf tissues were surface-disinfected with 75% ethanol and 0.1% HgCl then small pieces (1×1 cm), were placed onto potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium (Sigma-Aldrich, 70139) and incubated at 28°C for 6-9 days. Colonies were villiform and initially white, becoming gray after 6 days. Sterilized dissecting needles were used to pick single hyphal tips from the edge of the colonies and placed onto PDA for strain purification. After 15 days, the purified colonies grew fluffy white hyphae with abundant conidia. The conidia were cylindrical, had round ends, and ranged from 5.75 to 14.83 μm long and 1.75 to 2.38 μm wide (n=50). According to morphological and cultural characteristics, these isolates were preliminarily identified as Colletotrichum fructicola Prihast., L. Cai & K.D. Hyde (Damm et al. 2012). To further affirm the identity of the pathogen, DNA was extracted from mycelia using a DNA extraction kit (Sigma-Aldrich, G2N70). The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, the transcription elongation factor (TEF), and the actin (ACT) gene were then amplified from genomic DNA extracted from three isolates (Cof1, Cof2, and Cof3) using specific primers. The primers utilized were ITS1/ITS4 (White et al. 1990), EF1-728F/EF1-986R and ACT-512F/ACT-783R (Carbone and Kohn 1999) for ITS region, transcription elongation factor gene and actin gene amplification, respectively. Sequence identity indicated that these isolates were highly homologous to C. fructicola.

A neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree constructed using MEGA11 (Tamura et al. 2021) also indicated that these isolates were C. fructicola. Both morphological and molecular characteristics confirmed the identification of this pathogen as C. fructicola. Colletotrichum species are known to cause anthracnose disease in a variety of economically important crops (Sharma and Kulshrestha 2015). To further validate the ability of the isolated C. fructicola to induce the same symptoms as observed in the field, the pathogenicity assay was assessed following Koch's postulates (Gradmann, 2014). Conidial suspensions (1×105 conidia per mL) from three isolates were individually inoculated onto artificially wounded leaves of 3-year-old L. polystachyus. Negative controls were established by inoculating leaf wounds with sterile distilled water. The plants were incubated in a greenhouse at 28°C and 90% humidity with a 12-h photoperiod. The experiment was replicated three times. Necrotic lesions were observed on all pathogen-inoculated wounds within 6 days after inoculation, whereas controls showed no observable symptoms.

Study associations between food insecurity and severe hypoglycemia. Survey based cross-sectional study. Survey responses were collected in 2019 from 1,164 older (≥ 65 years) patients with type 2 diabetes treated with insulin or sulfonylureas. Risk ratios (RR) for economic and physical food insecurity associated with self-reported severe hypoglycemia (low blood glucose requiring assistance) adjusted for age, financial strain, HbA1c, Charlson comorbidity score and frailty. Self-reported reasons for hypoglycemia endorsed by respondents. Food insecurity was reported by 12.3% of the respondents; of whom 38.4% reported economic food insecurity only, 21.1% physical food insecurity only and 40.5% both.

38769364,A dynamic probabilistic model of the onset and interaction of cardio-metabolic comorbidities on an ageing adult population.,"Comorbidity is widespread in the ageing population, implying multiple and complex medical needs for individuals and a public health burden. Determining risk factors and predicting comorbidity development can help identify at-risk subjects and design prevention strategies. Using socio-demographic and clinical data from approximately 11,000 subjects monitored over 11 years in the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, we develop a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) to model the onset and interaction of three cardio-metabolic comorbidities, namely type 2 diabetes (T2D), hypertension, and heart problems. The DBN allows us to identify risk factors for developing each morbidity, simulate ageing progression over time, and stratify the population based on the risk of outcome occurrence. By applying hierarchical agglomerative clustering to the simulated, dynamic risk of experiencing morbidities, we identified patients with similar risk patterns and the variables contributing to their discrimination. The network reveals a direct joint effect of biomarkers and lifestyle on outcomes over time, such as the impact of fasting glucose, HbA1c, and BMI on T2D development. Mediated cross-relationships between comorbidities also emerge, showcasing the interconnected nature of these health issues. The model presents good calibration and discrimination ability, particularly in predicting the onset of T2D (iAUC-ROC = 0.828, iAUC-PR = 0.294) and survival (iAUC-ROC = 0.827, iAUC-PR = 0.311). Stratification analysis unveils two distinct clusters for all comorbidities, effectively discriminated by variables like HbA1c for T2D and age at baseline for heart problems. The developed DBN constitutes an effective, highly-explainable predictive risk tool for simulating and stratifying the dynamic risk of developing cardio-metabolic comorbidities.

38769291,First report of anthracnose of <i>Lithocarpus polystachyus</i> caused by <i>Colletotrichum fructicola</i> in China.,"Lithocarpus polystachyus (Wall. ex A. DC.), an economically valuable plant species belonging to the Fagaceae family, has been used as herbal tea to prevent diabetes because of the high content of flavonoids and dihydrochalcones in the leaves (Shang et al. 2022). In July 2022, the severe leaf lesion on L. polystachyus was first observed in Yongshun County, Xiangxi autonomous prefecture (28°45'34''N, 109°40'11''E), Hunan province, China. Yongshun County is characterized by hills and mountains, situated in a subtropical region with a mild and humid climate. A second outbreak in July 2023 was observed in the same area. The observed incident rates in the past two years were 87.3% and 90.6%, respectively. Once infected, almost all plant leaves will be infected, leading to a substantial reduction in the yield of L. polystachyus. The disease presented symptoms characterized by round or irregularly shaped lesions that initially manifested as brown spots. These lesions frequently merged into larger, dark-brown areas along the leaf margins before eventually wilting. To ascertain the pathogenic species responsible for this disease, fungal isolation was conducted using a tissue separation method (Xu et al. 2023). The infected leaf tissues were surface-disinfected with 75% ethanol and 0.1% HgCl then small pieces (1×1 cm), were placed onto potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium (Sigma-Aldrich, 70139) and incubated at 28°C for 6-9 days. Colonies were villiform and initially white, becoming gray after 6 days. Sterilized dissecting needles were used to pick single hyphal tips from the edge of the colonies and placed onto PDA for strain purification. After 15 days, the purified colonies grew fluffy white hyphae with abundant conidia. The conidia were cylindrical, had round ends, and ranged from 5.75 to 14.83 μm long and 1.75 to 2.38 μm wide (n=50). According to morphological and cultural characteristics, these isolates were preliminarily identified as Colletotrichum fructicola Prihast., L. Cai & K.D. Hyde (Damm et al. 2012). To further affirm the identity of the pathogen, DNA was extracted from mycelia using a DNA extraction kit (Sigma-Aldrich, G2N70). The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, the transcription elongation factor (TEF), and the actin (ACT) gene were then amplified from genomic DNA extracted from three isolates (Cof1, Cof2, and Cof3) using specific primers. The primers utilized were ITS1/ITS4 (White et al. 1990), EF1-728F/EF1-986R and ACT-512F/ACT-783R (Carbone and Kohn 1999) for ITS region, transcription elongation factor gene and actin gene amplification, respectively. Sequence identity indicated that these isolates were highly homologous to C. fructicola. The ITS (Genbank No. PP002156, OR880553 and OR880554), TEF (No. PP061421, PP061422 and PP061423), and ACT (No. PP061418, PP061419 and PP061420) sequences of the isolates Cof1, Cof2, and Cof3 shared 99 to 100% identity with their counterparts (No. OR083309, MF627961, and OQ427895) in C. fructicola, respectively. A neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree constructed using MEGA11 (Tamura et al. 2021) also indicated that these isolates were C. fructicola. Both morphological and molecular characteristics confirmed the identification of this pathogen as C. fructicola. Colletotrichum species are known to cause anthracnose disease in a variety of economically important crops (Sharma and Kulshrestha 2015). To further validate the ability of the isolated C. fructicola to induce the same symptoms as observed in the field, the pathogenicity assay was assessed following Koch's postulates (Gradmann, 2014). Conidial suspensions (1×105 conidia per mL) from three isolates were individually inoculated onto artificially wounded leaves of 3-year-old L. polystachyus. Negative controls were established by inoculating leaf wounds with sterile distilled water. The plants were incubated in a greenhouse at 28°C and 90% humidity with a 12-h photoperiod. The experiment was replicated three times. Necrotic lesions were observed on all pathogen-inoculated wounds within 6 days after inoculation, whereas controls showed no observable symptoms. Morphological and molecular characterization of re-isolated pathogens from infected leaves indicated that the pathogens were identical. To our knowledge, this is the first report of anthracnose of L. polystachyus caused by C. fructicola in China. Farmers in the local mountainous areas are economically reliant on L. polystachyus production, while anthracnose has caused over half of the trees to lose their commercial value, resulting in significant economic losses. Our findings hold great promise for advancing strategies in the prevention and treatment of anthracnose in L. polystachyus.",0,prevention
38767740,Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease and Ethnicity: Lessons Learned from the Arab Population in Israel.,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common liver disease. We aimed to investigate the potential similarities and differences regarding the disease among Arabs and Jews. Retrospective study included all patients older than 18 years with NAFLD diagnosis according to ICD-10 codes. Data regarding demographics, comorbidities, and outcomes were retrieved using the MdClone platform from ""Clalit"" in Israel. Data concerning 34,090 Arab patients and 173,500 Jewish patients with NAFLD were included. Arab patients were significantly younger at diagnosis (35.0 ± 13 years vs. 43.6 ± 15 years, p < 0.001) and had higher rates of obesity and diabetes mellitus (69.5% vs. 56.5% and 27.0% vs. 22.7%, p < 0.001, respectively). Arab patients had higher rates of cirrhosis and portal hypertension-related complications (2.5% vs. 2.0%, p < 0.001), esophageal varices (0.9% vs. 0.5%, p < 0.001), spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (0.3% vs. 0.1%, p < 0.001), and hepatorenal syndrome (0.3% vs. 0.1%, p < 0.001). There was no significant difference in the prevalence of hepatocellular carcinoma between study groups (0.4% vs. 0.5%, p = 0.156). Liver transplantation was performed in 0.2% of Arab NAFLD patients compared to 0.07% of Jewish NAFLD patients (p < 0.001). Lower rates of all-cause mortality were found among the Arab NAFLD patients versus Jewish NAFLD patients (7.7% versus 11.5%, p < 0.001). According to the Cox regression model, Arab ethnicity is a risk factor for death with OR of 1.36. Significant differences regarding comorbidities, complications, liver transplantations rates, and all-cause mortality were found among NAFLD patients of different ethnicities, hence specific population need specific consideration in prevention, early diagnosis and follow up.",0,prevention
38769011,Evaluation of systemic medications associated with diabetic retinopathy: a nested case-control study from the UK Biobank.,"This study aims to investigate the associations between commonly used systemic medications and diabetic retinopathy (DR). Individuals with linked primary care prescription data from the UK Biobank were included. Cases were defined as individuals with a Hospital Episode Statistics-coded or primary care recorded diagnosis of DR or self-reported DR. Controls were matched for age, sex, glycosylated haemoglobin, duration of diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension status and cardiovascular disease status. ORs and 95% CIs were calculated using conditional univariate and multivariable logistic regression models. A total of 3377 case subjects with DR were included in the study and matched with 3377 control subjects. In multivariable logistic regression, increased odds of incident DR were observed for exposure to short-acting insulins (OR 1.63; 95% CI 1.22 to 2.18), medium-acting insulins (OR 2.10; 95% CI 1.60 to 2.75), sulfonylureas (OR 1.30; 95% CI 1.16 to 1.46). Instead, the use of fibrates (OR 0.71; 95% CI 0.53 to 0.94) and Cox-2 inhibitors (OR 0.68; 95% CI 0.58 to 0.79) was associated with decreased odds of incident DR. Dose-response relationships were observed for all five drug categories (all p<0.05). This study comprehensively investigated the associations between systemic medication use and DR and found significant associations between the use of short-acting insulins, medium-acting insulins and sulfonylureas with increased odds of incident DR. In contrast, fibrates and Cox-2 inhibitors were associated with decreased odds of incident DR. These findings may provide valuable insights into DM medication management and serve as a reference for the prevention of DR in patients with DM.",0,prevention

38767674,Assessment of genetic and clinical factors in T2D susceptibility among patients with hypertension.,"Hypertension (HTN) and Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) often coexist, therefore understanding the relationship between both diseases is imperative to guide targeted prevention/therapy. This study aims to explore the relationship between HTN and T2D using genome-wide association study (GWAS) analysis and biochemical data to understand the implication of both clinical and genetic factors in these pathologies. A total of 2,876 patients were enrolled. Using GWAS and biochemical data, patients with both T2D and HTN were compared to patients with only HTN. Specificity was confirmed by testing the detected genetic variants for associations with HTN development in T2D patients, or with HTN in healthy subjects. Regression models were applied to examine the association of T2D in patients with HTN with cardiovascular risk factors. Replication was performed using UK Biobank dataset with 31,170 subjects. Data showed that females with HTN are at higher risk of developing T2D due to dyslipidemia, while males faced higher risk due to high BMI (body mass index) and family history of T2D. GWAS identified Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) linked to T2D in patients with HTN. Notably, rs7865889, rs7756992, and rs10896290 were positively associated with T2D, whereas rs12737517 yielded negative association. Three SNPs were replicated in the UK Biobank (rs10896290, rs7865889, and rs7756992). Incorporating clinical and genetic screening into risk assessment is important for the detection and prevention of T2D in patients with HTN. The detected SNPs (rs7865889, rs12737517, and rs10896290), especially the protective SNP (rs12737517), provide an opportunity for better diagnosis, prevention, and therapy of patients with T2D and HTN.",0,prevention

Economic food insecurity and physical food insecurity were strongly associated with severe hypoglycemia (RR = 4.3; p = 0.02 and RR = 4.4; p = 0.002, respectively). Missed meals (""skipped meals, not eating enough or waiting too long to eat"") was the dominant reason (77.5%) given for hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia prevention efforts among older patients with diabetes using hypoglycemia-prone medications should address food insecurity. Standard food insecurity questions, which are used to identify economic food insecurity, will fail to identify patients who have physical food insecurity only.",0,prevention
38767674,Assessment of genetic and clinical factors in T2D susceptibility among patients with hypertension.,"Hypertension (HTN) and Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) often coexist, therefore understanding the relationship between both diseases is imperative to guide targeted prevention/therapy. This study aims to explore the relationship between HTN and T2D using genome-wide association study (GWAS) analysis and biochemical data to understand the implication of both clinical and genetic factors in these pathologies. A total of 2,876 patients were enrolled. Using GWAS and biochemical data, patients with both T2D and HTN were compared to patients with only HTN. Specificity was confirmed by testing the detected genetic variants for associations with HTN development in T2D patients, or with HTN in healthy subjects. Regression models were applied to examine the association of T2D in patients with HTN with cardiovascular risk factors. Replication was performed using UK Biobank dataset with 31,170 subjects. Data showed that females with HTN are at higher risk of developing T2D due to dyslipidemia, while males faced higher risk due to high BMI (body mass index) and family history of T2D. GWAS identified Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) linked to T2D in patients with HTN. Notably, rs7865889, rs7756992, and rs10896290 were positively associated with T2D, whereas rs12737517 yielded negative association. Three SNPs were replicated in the UK Biobank (rs10896290, rs7865889, and rs7756992). Incorporating clinical and genetic screening into risk assessment is important for the detection and prevention of T2D in patients with HTN. The detected SNPs (rs7865889, rs12737517, and rs10896290), especially the protective SNP (rs12737517), provide an opportunity for better diagnosis, prevention, and therapy of patients with T2D and HTN.",0,prevention

We aimed to investigate the potential similarities and differences regarding the disease among Arabs and Jews. Retrospective study included all patients older than 18 years with NAFLD diagnosis according to ICD-10 codes. Data regarding demographics, comorbidities, and outcomes were retrieved using the MdClone platform from ""Clalit"" in Israel. Data concerning 34,090 Arab patients and 173,500 Jewish patients with NAFLD were included. Arab patients were significantly younger at diagnosis (35.0 ± 13 years vs. 43.6 ± 15 years, p < 0.001) and had higher rates of obesity and diabetes mellitus (69.5% vs. 56.5% and 27.0% vs. 22.7%, p < 0.001, respectively). Arab patients had higher rates of cirrhosis and portal hypertension-related complications (2.5% vs. 2.0%, p < 0.001), esophageal varices (0.9% vs. 0.5%, p < 0.001), spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (0.3% vs. 0.1%, p < 0.001), and hepatorenal syndrome (0.3% vs. 0.1%, p < 0.001).

Lower rates of all-cause mortality were found among the Arab NAFLD patients versus Jewish NAFLD patients (7.7% versus 11.5%, p < 0.001). According to the Cox regression model, Arab ethnicity is a risk factor for death with OR of 1.36. Significant differences regarding comorbidities, complications, liver transplantations rates, and all-cause mortality were found among NAFLD patients of different ethnicities, hence specific population need specific consideration in prevention, early diagnosis and follow up.",0,prevention
38769364,A dynamic probabilistic model of the onset and interaction of cardio-metabolic comorbidities on an ageing adult population.,"Comorbidity is widespread in the ageing population, implying multiple and complex medical needs for individuals and a public health burden. Determining risk factors and predicting comorbidity development can help identify at-risk subjects and design prevention strategies. Using socio-demographic and clinical data from approximately 11,000 subjects monitored over 11 years in the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, we develop a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) to model the onset and interaction of three cardio-metabolic comorbidities, namely type 2 diabetes (T2D), hypertension, and heart problems. The DBN allows us to identify risk factors for developing each morbidity, simulate ageing progression over time, and stratify the population based on the risk of outcome occurrence. By applying hierarchical agglomerative clustering to the simulated, dynamic risk of experiencing morbidities, we identified patients with similar risk patterns and the variables contributing to their discrimination. The network reveals a direct joint effect of biomarkers and lifestyle on outcomes over time, such as the impact of fasting glucose, HbA1c, and BMI on T2D development. Mediated cross-relationships between comorbidities also emerge, showcasing the interconnected nature of these health issues. The model presents good calibration and discrimination ability, particularly in predicting the onset of T2D (iAUC-ROC = 0.828, iAUC-PR = 0.294) and survival (iAUC-ROC = 0.827, iAUC-PR = 0.311). Stratification analysis unveils two distinct clusters for all comorbidities, effectively discriminated by variables like HbA1c for T2D and age at baseline for heart problems. The developed DBN constitutes an effective, highly-explainable predictive risk tool for simulating and stratifying the dynamic risk of developing cardio-metabolic comorbidities. Its use could help identify the effects of risk factors and develop health policies that prevent the occurrence of comorbidities.",0,prevention

38769291,First report of anthracnose of <i>Lithocarpus polystachyus</i> caused by <i>Colletotrichum fructicola</i> in China.,"Lithocarpus polystachyus (Wall. ex A. DC.), an economically valuable plant species belonging to the Fagaceae family, has been used as herbal tea to prevent diabetes because of the high content of flavonoids and dihydrochalcones in the leaves (Shang et al. 2022). In July 2022, the severe leaf lesion on L. polystachyus was first observed in Yongshun County, Xiangxi autonomous prefecture (28°45'34''N, 109°40'11''E), Hunan province, China. Yongshun County is characterized by hills and mountains, situated in a subtropical region with a mild and humid climate. A second outbreak in July 2023 was observed in the same area. The observed incident rates in the past two years were 87.3% and 90.6%, respectively. Once infected, almost all plant leaves will be infected, leading to a substantial reduction in the yield of L. polystachyus. The disease presented symptoms characterized by round or irregularly shaped lesions that initially manifested as brown spots. These lesions frequently merged into larger, dark-brown areas along the leaf margins before eventually wilting. To ascertain the pathogenic species responsible for this disease, fungal isolation was conducted using a tissue separation method (Xu et al. 2023). The infected leaf tissues were surface-disinfected with 75% ethanol and 0.1% HgCl then small pieces (1×1 cm), were placed onto potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium (Sigma-Aldrich, 70139) and incubated at 28°C for 6-9 days. Colonies were villiform and initially white, becoming gray after 6 days. Sterilized dissecting needles were used to pick single hyphal tips from the edge of the colonies and placed onto PDA for strain purification. After 15 days, the purified colonies grew fluffy white hyphae with abundant conidia. The conidia were cylindrical, had round ends, and ranged from 5.75 to 14.83 μm long and 1.75 to 2.38 μm wide (n=50). According to morphological and cultural characteristics, these isolates were preliminarily identified as Colletotrichum fructicola Prihast., L. Cai & K.D. Hyde (Damm et al. 2012). To further affirm the identity of the pathogen, DNA was extracted from mycelia using a DNA extraction kit (Sigma-Aldrich, G2N70). The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, the transcription elongation factor (TEF), and the actin (ACT) gene were then amplified from genomic DNA extracted from three isolates (Cof1, Cof2, and Cof3) using specific primers. The primers utilized were ITS1/ITS4 (White et al. 1990), EF1-728F/EF1-986R and ACT-512F/ACT-783R (Carbone and Kohn 1999) for ITS region, transcription elongation factor gene and actin gene amplification, respectively. Sequence identity indicated that these isolates were highly homologous to C. fructicola. The ITS (Genbank No. PP002156, OR880553 and OR880554), TEF (No. PP061421, PP061422 and PP061423), and ACT (No. PP061418, PP061419 and PP061420) sequences of the isolates Cof1, Cof2, and Cof3 shared 99 to 100% identity with their counterparts (No. OR083309, MF627961, and OQ427895) in C. fructicola, respectively. A neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree constructed using MEGA11 (Tamura et al. 2021) also indicated that these isolates were C. fructicola. Both morphological and molecular characteristics confirmed the identification of this pathogen as C. fructicola. Colletotrichum species are known to cause anthracnose disease in a variety of economically important crops (Sharma and Kulshrestha 2015). To further validate the ability of the isolated C. fructicola to induce the same symptoms as observed in the field, the pathogenicity assay was assessed following Koch's postulates (Gradmann, 2014). Conidial suspensions (1×105 conidia per mL) from three isolates were individually inoculated onto artificially wounded leaves of 3-year-old L. polystachyus. Negative controls were established by inoculating leaf wounds with sterile distilled water. The plants were incubated in a greenhouse at 28°C and 90% humidity with a 12-h photoperiod. The experiment was replicated three times. Necrotic lesions were observed on all pathogen-inoculated wounds within 6 days after inoculation, whereas controls showed no observable symptoms. Morphological and molecular characterization of re-isolated pathogens from infected leaves indicated that the pathogens were identical. To our knowledge, this is the first report of anthracnose of L. polystachyus caused by C. fructicola in China. Farmers in the local mountainous areas are economically reliant on L. polystachyus production, while anthracnose has caused over half of the trees to lose their commercial value, resulting in significant economic losses. Our findings hold great promise for advancing strategies in the prevention and treatment of anthracnose in L. polystachyus.",0,prevention

We evaluated the relationships of 16 known SNPs and T1D-GRS2 with area under the curve (AUC) C-peptide levels during oral glucose tolerance tests conducted in the 9 months before diagnosis. Higher T1D-GRS2 was associated with lower C-peptide AUC in the 9 months before diagnosis in univariate (β=-0.06, P<0.0001) and multivariate (β=-0.03, P=0.005) analyses. Participants with the JAZF1 rs864745 T allele had lower C-peptide AUC in both univariate (β=-0.11, P=0.002) and multivariate (β=-0.06, P=0.018) analyses. The type 2 diabetes-associated JAZF1 rs864745 T allele and higher T1D-GRS2 are associated with lower C-peptide AUC prior to diagnosis of type 1 diabetes, with implications for the design of prevention trials.",0,prevention
38769364,A dynamic probabilistic model of the onset and interaction of cardio-metabolic comorbidities on an ageing adult population.,"Comorbidity is widespread in the ageing population, implying multiple and complex medical needs for individuals and a public health burden. Determining risk factors and predicting comorbidity development can help identify at-risk subjects and design prevention strategies. Using socio-demographic and clinical data from approximately 11,000 subjects monitored over 11 years in the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, we develop a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) to model the onset and interaction of three cardio-metabolic comorbidities, namely type 2 diabetes (T2D), hypertension, and heart problems. The DBN allows us to identify risk factors for developing each morbidity, simulate ageing progression over time, and stratify the population based on the risk of outcome occurrence. By applying hierarchical agglomerative clustering to the simulated, dynamic risk of experiencing morbidities, we identified patients with similar risk patterns and the variables contributing to their discrimination. The network reveals a direct joint effect of biomarkers and lifestyle on outcomes over time, such as the impact of fasting glucose, HbA1c, and BMI on T2D development. Mediated cross-relationships between comorbidities also emerge, showcasing the interconnected nature of these health issues. The model presents good calibration and discrimination ability, particularly in predicting the onset of T2D (iAUC-ROC = 0.828, iAUC-PR = 0.294) and survival (iAUC-ROC = 0.827, iAUC-PR = 0.311). Stratification analysis unveils two distinct clusters for all comorbidities, effectively discriminated by variables like HbA1c for T2D and age at baseline for heart problems. The developed DBN constitutes an effective, highly-explainable predictive risk tool for simulating and stratifying the dynamic risk of developing cardio-metabolic comorbidities. Its use could help identify the effects of risk factors and develop health policies that prevent the occurrence of comorbidities.",0,prevention

38769011,Evaluation of systemic medications associated with diabetic retinopathy: a nested case-control study from the UK Biobank.,"This study aims to investigate the associations between commonly used systemic medications and diabetic retinopathy (DR). Individuals with linked primary care prescription data from the UK Biobank were included. Cases were defined as individuals with a Hospital Episode Statistics-coded or primary care recorded diagnosis of DR or self-reported DR. Controls were matched for age, sex, glycosylated haemoglobin, duration of diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension status and cardiovascular disease status. ORs and 95% CIs were calculated using conditional univariate and multivariable logistic regression models. A total of 3377 case subjects with DR were included in the study and matched with 3377 control subjects. In multivariable logistic regression, increased odds of incident DR were observed for exposure to short-acting insulins (OR 1.63; 95% CI 1.22 to 2.18), medium-acting insulins (OR 2.10; 95% CI 1.60 to 2.75), sulfonylureas (OR 1.30; 95% CI 1.16 to 1.46). Instead, the use of fibrates (OR 0.71; 95% CI 0.53 to 0.94) and Cox-2 inhibitors (OR 0.68; 95% CI 0.58 to 0.79) was associated with decreased odds of incident DR. Dose-response relationships were observed for all five drug categories (all p<0.05). This study comprehensively investigated the associations between systemic medication use and DR and found significant associations between the use of short-acting insulins, medium-acting insulins and sulfonylureas with increased odds of incident DR. In contrast, fibrates and Cox-2 inhibitors were associated with decreased odds of incident DR. These findings may provide valuable insights into DM medication management and serve as a reference for the prevention of DR in patients with DM.",0,prevention

Its diverse range of manifestations complicates the treatment approach for patients. Although kidney biopsy is considered the gold standard for diagnosis, it lacks precision in predicting the progression of kidney dysfunction. Herein, we addressed whether the presence of glomerular crescents is linked to the outcomes in patients with biopsy-confirmed type 2 DKD. We performed a retrospective evaluation, involving 327 patients diagnosed with biopsy-confirmed DKD in the context of type 2 diabetes, excluding cases with other glomerular diseases, from nine tertiary hospitals. Hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated using a Cox regression model to assess the risk of kidney disease progression, defined as either ≥ 50% decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rates or the development of end-stage kidney disease, based on the presence of glomerular crescents. Out of the 327 patients selected, ten patients had glomerular crescents observed in their biopsied tissues. Over the follow-up period (median of 19 months, with a maximum of 18 years), the crescent group exhibited a higher risk of kidney disease progression than the no crescent group, with an adjusted HR of 2.82 (1.32-6.06) (P = 0.008). The presence of heavy proteinuria was associated with an increased risk of developing glomerular crescents. The presence of glomerular crescents is indeed linked to the progression of type 2 DKD. Therefore, it is important to determine whether there is an additional immune-mediated glomerulonephritis requiring immunomodulation, and it may be prudent to monitor the histology and repeat a biopsy.",1,diagnosis

This retrospective cohort analysis compared erythrocytic parameters between patients with CS of pituitary (CD) and adrenal (aCS) etiology and age, sex, body mass index (BMI) and socioeconomic status-matched controls in a 1:5 ratio. Laboratory values at baseline were calculated as mean values during the year preceding CS diagnosis, and over one year thereafter. The cohort included 397 CS patients (68.26% female; mean age 51.11 ± 16.85 years) and 1970 controls. Patients with CS had significantly higher baseline median levels of hemoglobin (Hgb) (13.70 g/dL vs. 13.12 g/dL [p < 0.0001]) and hematocrit (Hct) (41.64% vs. 39.80% [p < 0.0001]) compared to controls. These differences were observed for both CD and aCS and for both sexes. Patients who attained remission had Hgb and Hct levels comparable to controls (13.20 g/dL and 40.08% in patients with CD and aCS vs. 13.20 g/dL and 39.98% in controls). Meanwhile, those with persistent/recurrent disease maintained elevated levels. Patients with comorbid DM had similar Hgb but higher Hct (p = 0.0419), while patients without DM showed elevated erythrocytic values compared to controls (p < 0.0001). Our data illustrates that erythrocytic parameters are directly influenced by glucocorticoid excess as Hgb and Hct are higher in patients with CS, and normalize after remission.

This longitudinal, population-based study used the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database (2004 to 2020) as a data source. Propensity score matching (PSM) (sex, age, comorbidities and concurrent medication use) was employed in the grouping of T2DM patients according to different frequency of DR screening. Outcome measures included the proportion of patients who developed DR, who received DR treatment, and the associated medical expenses and hospitalizations. The 17-year cohort included 337,046 patients. After PSM, three groups each containing 35,739 patients were assembled and analyzed. Compared to low-frequency screening, high-frequency screening was more effective in detecting patients requiring treatment; however, the net cost for treatment was significantly lower. Standard-frequency screening appears to provide the best balance in terms of DR detection, diagnosis interval, the risk of DR-related hospitalization, and DR treatment costs. In this real-world cohort study covering all levels of the healthcare system, infrequent screening was associated with delayed diagnosis and elevated treatment costs, while a fundus screening interval of 1-2 years proved optimal in terms of detection and medical expenditures.",1,diagnosis

Its diverse range of manifestations complicates the treatment approach for patients. Although kidney biopsy is considered the gold standard for diagnosis, it lacks precision in predicting the progression of kidney dysfunction. Herein, we addressed whether the presence of glomerular crescents is linked to the outcomes in patients with biopsy-confirmed type 2 DKD. We performed a retrospective evaluation, involving 327 patients diagnosed with biopsy-confirmed DKD in the context of type 2 diabetes, excluding cases with other glomerular diseases, from nine tertiary hospitals. Hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated using a Cox regression model to assess the risk of kidney disease progression, defined as either ≥ 50% decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rates or the development of end-stage kidney disease, based on the presence of glomerular crescents. Out of the 327 patients selected, ten patients had glomerular crescents observed in their biopsied tissues. Over the follow-up period (median of 19 months, with a maximum of 18 years), the crescent group exhibited a higher risk of kidney disease progression than the no crescent group, with an adjusted HR of 2.82 (1.32-6.06) (P = 0.008). The presence of heavy proteinuria was associated with an increased risk of developing glomerular crescents. The presence of glomerular crescents is indeed linked to the progression of type 2 DKD. Therefore, it is important to determine whether there is an additional immune-mediated glomerulonephritis requiring immunomodulation, and it may be prudent to monitor the histology and repeat a biopsy.",1,diagnosis

This retrospective cohort analysis compared erythrocytic parameters between patients with CS of pituitary (CD) and adrenal (aCS) etiology and age, sex, body mass index (BMI) and socioeconomic status-matched controls in a 1:5 ratio. Laboratory values at baseline were calculated as mean values during the year preceding CS diagnosis, and over one year thereafter. The cohort included 397 CS patients (68.26% female; mean age 51.11 ± 16.85 years) and 1970 controls. Patients with CS had significantly higher baseline median levels of hemoglobin (Hgb) (13.70 g/dL vs. 13.12 g/dL [p < 0.0001]) and hematocrit (Hct) (41.64% vs. 39.80% [p < 0.0001]) compared to controls. These differences were observed for both CD and aCS and for both sexes. Patients who attained remission had Hgb and Hct levels comparable to controls (13.20 g/dL and 40.08% in patients with CD and aCS vs. 13.20 g/dL and 39.98% in controls). Meanwhile, those with persistent/recurrent disease maintained elevated levels. Patients with comorbid DM had similar Hgb but higher Hct (p = 0.0419), while patients without DM showed elevated erythrocytic values compared to controls (p < 0.0001). Our data illustrates that erythrocytic parameters are directly influenced by glucocorticoid excess as Hgb and Hct are higher in patients with CS, and normalize after remission. We have identified the influence of DM on erythrocytic parameters in patients with CS for the first time.",1,diagnosis

Herein, we addressed whether the presence of glomerular crescents is linked to the outcomes in patients with biopsy-confirmed type 2 DKD. We performed a retrospective evaluation, involving 327 patients diagnosed with biopsy-confirmed DKD in the context of type 2 diabetes, excluding cases with other glomerular diseases, from nine tertiary hospitals. Hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated using a Cox regression model to assess the risk of kidney disease progression, defined as either ≥ 50% decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rates or the development of end-stage kidney disease, based on the presence of glomerular crescents. Out of the 327 patients selected, ten patients had glomerular crescents observed in their biopsied tissues. Over the follow-up period (median of 19 months, with a maximum of 18 years), the crescent group exhibited a higher risk of kidney disease progression than the no crescent group, with an adjusted HR of 2.82 (1.32-6.06) (P = 0.008).

This retrospective cohort analysis compared erythrocytic parameters between patients with CS of pituitary (CD) and adrenal (aCS) etiology and age, sex, body mass index (BMI) and socioeconomic status-matched controls in a 1:5 ratio. Laboratory values at baseline were calculated as mean values during the year preceding CS diagnosis, and over one year thereafter. The cohort included 397 CS patients (68.26% female; mean age 51.11 ± 16.85 years) and 1970 controls. Patients with CS had significantly higher baseline median levels of hemoglobin (Hgb) (13.70 g/dL vs. 13.12 g/dL [p < 0.0001]) and hematocrit (Hct) (41.64% vs. 39.80% [p < 0.0001]) compared to controls. These differences were observed for both CD and aCS and for both sexes. Patients who attained remission had Hgb and Hct levels comparable to controls (13.20 g/dL and 40.08% in patients with CD and aCS vs. 13.20 g/dL and 39.98% in controls). Meanwhile, those with persistent/recurrent disease maintained elevated levels. Patients with comorbid DM had similar Hgb but higher Hct (p = 0.0419), while patients without DM showed elevated erythrocytic values compared to controls (p < 0.0001).

38768659,Cost-Effectiveness of Diabetic Retinopathy Screening for Newly Diagnosed Type 2 Diabetic Patients: A Nationwide Population-based Propensity Score-Matched Cohort Study.,"This study investigated the association between the frequency of screening for diabetic retinopathy (DR) versus the development of DR and corresponding medical expenses among patients newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This longitudinal, population-based study used the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database (2004 to 2020) as a data source. Propensity score matching (PSM) (sex, age, comorbidities and concurrent medication use) was employed in the grouping of T2DM patients according to different frequency of DR screening. Outcome measures included the proportion of patients who developed DR, who received DR treatment, and the associated medical expenses and hospitalizations. The 17-year cohort included 337,046 patients. After PSM, three groups each containing 35,739 patients were assembled and analyzed. Compared to low-frequency screening, high-frequency screening was more effective in detecting patients requiring treatment; however, the net cost for treatment was significantly lower. Standard-frequency screening appears to provide the best balance in terms of DR detection, diagnosis interval, the risk of DR-related hospitalization, and DR treatment costs. In this real-world cohort study covering all levels of the healthcare system, infrequent screening was associated with delayed diagnosis and elevated treatment costs, while a fundus screening interval of 1-2 years proved optimal in terms of detection and medical expenditures.",1,diagnosis

Their quality was evaluated by four reviewers using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation Ⅱ (AGREE Ⅱ) instrument. Along with the item and domain scores, the guideline was also allocated an overall quality score, which ranged from 1 (lowest possible quality) to 7 (highest possible quality). Moreover, an overall recommendation for use was also assigned (""recommended"", ""recommended with modifications"" or ""not recommended""). A total of 16 CPGs were included, of which 14 were from Asia and the remaining two from Europe. These two CPGs were updated in the third version. Six CPGs were recommended for use because their primary domains scored in the medium or high category. Furthermore, five CPGs were recommended with modifications as the stakeholder involvement, applicability, and editorial independence domains were evaluated as low categories. In all domains, the lowest average score was for rigour of development (33%), followed by application (36%), and stakeholder involvement (51%). The highest average score was for scope and purpose (79%), followed by clarity of presentation (75%).

38769500,Glomerular crescents are associated with the risk of type 2 diabetic kidney disease progression: a retrospective cohort study.,"Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) stands as the predominant cause of chronic kidney disease and end-stage kidney disease. Its diverse range of manifestations complicates the treatment approach for patients. Although kidney biopsy is considered the gold standard for diagnosis, it lacks precision in predicting the progression of kidney dysfunction. Herein, we addressed whether the presence of glomerular crescents is linked to the outcomes in patients with biopsy-confirmed type 2 DKD. We performed a retrospective evaluation, involving 327 patients diagnosed with biopsy-confirmed DKD in the context of type 2 diabetes, excluding cases with other glomerular diseases, from nine tertiary hospitals. Hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated using a Cox regression model to assess the risk of kidney disease progression, defined as either ≥ 50% decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rates or the development of end-stage kidney disease, based on the presence of glomerular crescents. Out of the 327 patients selected, ten patients had glomerular crescents observed in their biopsied tissues. Over the follow-up period (median of 19 months, with a maximum of 18 years), the crescent group exhibited a higher risk of kidney disease progression than the no crescent group, with an adjusted HR of 2.82 (1.32-6.06) (P = 0.008). The presence of heavy proteinuria was associated with an increased risk of developing glomerular crescents. The presence of glomerular crescents is indeed linked to the progression of type 2 DKD. Therefore, it is important to determine whether there is an additional immune-mediated glomerulonephritis requiring immunomodulation, and it may be prudent to monitor the histology and repeat a biopsy.",1,diagnosis
